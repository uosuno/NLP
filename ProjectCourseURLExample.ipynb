Myneni.His petition has a single sentence that he hopes will be endorsed by a billion humans by the time Earth Day rolls around in 2014.Yeah, that's no typo: One Billion people.Here's what the petition says:Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon,We, the People of the Earth, request You to act judiciously and expeditiously to protect the Earth from anthropogenic climate change.Respectfully,People of the EarthStart Date: March 1st;, 2013End Date: April 22nd;, 2014 (Earth Day)When I first saw the link posted by a third party on the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Facebook page on Friday morning, I was skeptical.It sounded kind of cool, but kind of crazy too, so I started checking out Myneni's credentials.I found out that Myneni is no crank or fluffy-headed dreamer.On the contrary, he's a professor at Boston University, a respected expert on how vegetation is globally responding to climate change and one of the authors of the next global climate assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).I tracked down Myneni in Washington, D.C., on Friday where he was giving a talk to NASA researchers.I spoke to him by phone as he was waiting for a plane back to Boston at Reagan National Airport.\"I'm not speaking for (Boston University or the IPCC),\" Myneni told me, over the roar of the airport PA system.\"I'm speaking only for myself as an individual.\"Despite all the climate science and the scientific meetings and attempts to inform policy makers, he said, nothing substantive has been done to address climate change.And more scientists talking to scientists and politically hobbled policy makers isn't likely to change that.\"What we need are the people on the street,\" Myneni said.\"Everybody else: (e.g.)school children and their grandmothers.Their voices must be heard.They must be part of the process.\"But how?A simple, straightforward climate action petition seemed like a good idea.So Myneni and a friend started putting together a single webpage to that end.\"It would be the largest petition ever,\" he said.And it would send a message to the policy makers that we are all in this together.\"It would have some impact, I would think.\"All the work behind the petition -- hosting, archiving and securing data, etc.-- is done voluntarily and no money is involved, he said.More people have stepped forward recently to translate the petition into other languages and Myneni expects that by the end of March there will be German, Chinese and some other languages represented.\"I don't want money or sponsorship from anybody,\" he said.\"I want to keep it clean and very simple.\"That said, if the petition gets too unwieldy, he'd welcome non-monetary assistance from organizations like Facebook or Google.Keeping track of hundreds of millions of names is not for amateurs, after all.If everybody who signs the petition gets ten more people to sign, a billion is a real mathematical possibility, he said.This could prove to be an interesting petition to watch evolve over the next 13 months.You know how gloomy the global climate picture looks: temperatures are inching up.Droughts are on the rise.Populations are growing.Forests and grassland are disappearing.And about a billion people live on land that is threatening to turn into desert.But is there a simple fix for desertification -- and has it been under our noses the whole time?Allan Savory thinks so.An award-winning biologist and land management expert, Savory gave what was widely seen as one of the most astonishing talks at the TED 2013 conference in Long Beach last week.(You can see it in full, above).The solution?Put thousands of animals onto land that is threatening to turn into desert.Bunch that livestock together as a herd and move it around at speed, in a way that mimics the great herds of ages past.What you'll find, as Savory has time and again, is that with all that trampling and fertilization, the grassland will bloom again, fast enough to make your head spin.A climate bonus: you'll take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by preventing the release of carbon from the soil, and removing the need to burn grassland so next year's growth can come through.Savory says employing this technique globally is the equivalent of removing 6,000 cars from the road every second.The livestock fix is completely counterintuitive for biologists, who long believed that animals were causing desertification, not fixing it.Savory himself insisted on this for years.Based on his recommendations as a young researcher, African national parks killed around 40,000 elephants.\"That was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,\" Savory says.\"I will carry that to my grave.\"But it also gave him impetus to figure out how to really fix the problem.Now he has it, Savory says, \"I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet, for our children, for their children, and for all of humanity.\"What's your take on Savory's solution?Watch the video above and let us know in the comments.Climate change and global warming may cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal cities across the world.Over the past century, the Global Mean Sea Level has risen by 4 to 8 inches.And according to estimates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (PDF), it will keep rising between 8 inches and 6.6 feet by 2100.How will the world look if that happens?In November of 2012, The New York Times published interactive maps displaying the effects of the sea level rising, in a series titled \"What Could Disappear?\"The maps show how much land the sea will claim in the future, if it rises by 5, 12, and 25 feet.Nickolay Lamm, a 24-year-old researcher and artist saw the interactive maps and wondered: \"What would this actually look like in real life?\"Lamm told Mashable in an email interview that \"the only imagery I had of sea level rise came from Hollywood.\"So he decided to put his skills to work.\"I felt that if I could bring these maps to life, it would force people to look at sea level rise in a new way,\" he said.On February 8 he got in touch with Remik Ziemlinski, from Climate Central, who had helped the Times create the maps and he received the high-resolution maps from him.Lamm then chose different U.S. landmarks to illustrate the potential floods and found stock photos of the landmarks (he initially wanted to use screenshots of Apple 3D Maps but couldn't get permission from Apple to use them).He decided to use the same levels the Times had.To \"figure out the depth of flooding for each sea level rise,\" he used Google Earth and topography maps.Once he had all that figured out, all he needed was to work with Photoshop.Lamm told Mashable that it took approximately between 5 and 15 hours for each scene to be illustrated.This week, he finished working on them and he now has sets of four images, showing eight different locations in the United States and how they might look if the sea level keeps rising.His project was commissioned by StorageFront.com.We made GIFs of the scenes he created.Take a look at them below.1.A view of Ocean Drive, in Miami, FL2.A view of Miami's South Beach, FL3.The Statue of Liberty, New York, NY4.The Washington Monument, Washington, D.C.5.The Jefferson Memorial, Washington, DC6.The Harvard University campus, Cambridge, MA7.The Boston Harbor Hotel, Boston, MA8.A view of the Back Bay neighborhood, Boston, MAHow will the rising seas caused by climate change swallow up your city?Nickolay Lamm, a 24-year-old researcher and artist has worked on answering this question for months now.In April, he created illustrations of how the increased sea level will impact cities in the U.S. like Miami, New York and Washington, D.C. Mashable turned them into GIFs that showed how much our world could potentially change if the earth's ice caps melt.Now, Lamm has created eight new sets of illustrations, depicting how San Diego, San Francisco, and Charleston will look under five, 12, and 25 feet of seawater.Just like the first batch, Lamm, whose project has been sponsored by StorageFront.com, used data from Climate Central, which

Communication Fellows program, hiring 21 \"early to mid-career Ph.D. scientists nominated by leaders in climate change research and science-based institutions across the U.S.\" On July 11, they threw a fundraiser for the reelection campaign of Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), a man who loudly dismisses climate change as a hoax.Something, as they say, had to give.A strongly worded letter, signed by 17 of those 21 outstandingly intelligent fellows, found its way to Google CEO Larry Page and executive chairman Eric Schmidt.In it, the Google scientists blast their company for its opportunistic affiliation:Among his most notorious statements, Senator Inhofe has outrageously claimed that climate change is \"a hoax on the American people\" and, in the absence of a shred of factual evidence, accused climate scientists of being \"criminals.\"Given Google's commitment to educating the public about climate change, why would the company align its political efforts with Inhofe?In responding to criticism, a Google spokesperson acknowledged \"while we disagree on climate change policy, we share an interest with Senator Inhofe in the employees and data center we have in Oklahoma.\"But Inhofe's assault on the scientific community is not a difference in climate policy; it's a strategy designed to promote dysfunction and paralysis; to destroy the reputation of scientists and the legitimacy of their institutions; and to undermine our ability to find common ground.Google doubled the size of that data center in Oklahoma last year, raising their investment in the state to $700 million, so it's not shocking that their interests align somewhat with Inhofe's.But according to Data Center Knowledge, in \"an effort to make more renewable energy available to the regional grid, Google has also entered into a long-term agreement to purchase all of the energy from NextEra Energy Resources\" Minco II wind facility.Whose side are you on, Google?Google's own employees aren't the only ones publicly shaming the Internet giant, of course.A grassroots effort has produced several petitions on the matter and racked up thousands upon thousands of signatures.The activist website SumOfUs painted a stark picture of the flow of Google's money, not just to Inhofe but into the coffers of junk science organizations:Earlier this month, Google hosted a $2,500-a-plate fundraiser for one of the world's most powerful climate change deniers, Senator Jim Inhofe.And just two weeks before that, Google poured $50,000 into the coffers of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank that is also funded by the likes of the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil to put out faux \"studies\" that are used by policy-makers to deny climate change exists.Meanwhile, CREDO Action noted that Inhofe's climate position is hardly his sole failing as a political leader; he's \"also anti-women's rights, anti-labor, anti-internet freedom, anti-LGBT rights, anti-Obamacare, anti-gun control, anti-immigration reform, pro-fracking and pro-war.\"Not exactly in keeping with Google’s corporate slogan, \"Don't be evil,\" which petitioners have repurposed as the rallying cry \"Don't fund evil.\"Tonight, in fact, will see another protest against the company's political partnerships.Forecast the Facts, a group pressing for the acceptance of climate change as verified and incontrovertible truth, is calling on activists to crash the exclusive launch party for Google's Moto X smartphone.The event is scheduled for 8 p.m. at The Waterfront in Manhattan, and in addition to the demonstration, Forecast the Facts wants activists to flood social media with \"the #MeetMotoX and #DontFundEvil hashtags to spread awareness that Google's new 'hero phone' is financing anti-science villains.\"Between the NSA revelations and missteps like these, it often seems that Google has lost the sheen of a new, cuddly, California-liberal sort of company and begun to symbolize a troubling status quo.What's more, customers are beginning to realize that the Internet is no longer just a big idea -- it's big business.H/T ThinkProgressIf you follow climate science at all, you’ve probably heard that a warming world is likely to generate more nasty weather and a lot more weather extremes, kind of like the extreme droughts and then torrential flooding that Colorado, New Mexico and other western states have experienced.Well that also goes for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, according to a new study by researchers who used a new computer simulation to test the conditions which generate tornadoes.Their results suggests that we and our progeny are in for some pretty terrible twisters in coming decades — a lot like those that ripped up the U.S. in 2012.Specifically, by the year 2070 severe thunderstorms in the eastern United States could rise by 40%, the researchers say.Ouch.The key to the work is understanding how moist low-level air convects upward and carries water vapor high into the atmosphere to generate a storm.Previous models suggested that as the planet warms some aspects of how this convection works would be enhanced, while others stunted.So it was a toss up whether a warmer planet would generate more and more dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes.But Stanford University researcher Noah Diffenbaugh and his colleagues found that this canceling effect was only true sometimes, and that there is an overall increase in storms on a hotter Earth.They have published their findings in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.So what do we do about it?It turns out that despite the long history of dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we can slow down the warming and give our civilization and the ecosystems we depend on more time to adapt and survive, according to some earlier studies.All we have to do is get a grip on the greenhouse gas emissions and reverse the current trend, which is still very much headed in the wrong direction.So it’s not too late to do something.Climate change isn't an issue for any one government or any one region.Carbon pollution has taken a devastating toll across the

aggregating your activity, whether it's steps taken or money spent, \"smart\" consumer products aim to help you see patterns in your life, giving you the information you need to change them for the better.Perhaps the most unexpected place smart technology has cropped up in recent years is in climate control.When the Nest thermostat debuted in 2011, it awoke a sleepy category with novel tech and sleek design, and got us to look at those round things sticking out of our walls not as ugly necessities but as beautiful lifehacking devices.[seealso slug=\"nest-protect\"]\"Sensors and the data they generate are key, but they are really just a means to an end,\" says Maxime Veron, director of product marketing at Nest.\"Our approach is to take the data and turn it into information that customers can act upon.\"A thermostat is plugged directly into one of the biggest energy suckers in the home, so it's hardly a surprise that using it smarter can lead to big savings.The question was how, and it turned out the answer was in technologies that had already become ubiquitous: smartphones, Wi-Fi and the Internet.\"The big inflection point was when everybody got the smartphone in their pocket and could access controls to their house remotely,\" says Brad Paine, director of product marketing, software services for Honeywell's Environmental and Combustion Controls Division.\"Also, the convergence of the reliability of Wi-Fi and low-cost sensors.It's really here now -- the explosion of connected products.\"Intelligent Climate ControlSmart thermostats like the Nest, Honeywell's and others work by gathering information about how you use them.Every time you adjust the device, it learns a little more about your habits and preferences.You can also give it a schedule and target temperatures if you want to get specific.Of course, life doesn't always adhere to a schedule.Sometimes you're home or out when you didn't expect to be, and stays and absences can often get extended.At the same time, your room-specific habits within a home are another layer of data that can help optimize climate control.By adding certain kinds of sensors into the mix, those complications can become part of the equation.To some extent, a smart thermostat can do this already with simple proximity sensors -- walk in front of it and it knows you're home.But that concept can go to the next level, even geofence devices -- that is, know whether or not someone's home by detecting their cellphone.Determining occupancy via cellphone is easy and probably reliable, although the data isn't that granular.You don't necessarily have room-by-room information, and there's no data gathered about the home itself.For that, you'd need a network of sensors.The Internet of Household Things\"When we look at these things, we first think about saving dollars and then saving pennies,\" says Paine.\"If we can identify when people are home and away correctly, those are big dollar savings.The next step is fine-tuning when you're in the house and really optimizing it.\"The problem with deploying a sensor network in your home is that it's potentially expensive, and the gains -- the \"pennies\" side of things -- aren't as meaningful.However, there may be a way a sensor network could hitchhike into your house via other gadgets.One example is Nest's own Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector.Like the thermostat, it's a device you need in your home anyway, so why not make it smart, connected and -- what the hell -- eye-catching.It's essentially a big, beautiful sensor on your ceiling.The Nest Protect is just one step down this road.Nest has also opened up its platform to developers so they can create apps and even hardware that can tie into the company's products.The logical end point is a house in which every appliance and gadget \"talks\" to one another -- an Internet of Household Things -- sharing their sensor data and reacting to it, all without the cost or hassle of a whole-house installation.\"There's a greater calling than just data and sensors,\" says Nest's Veron.\"Having a feature is one thing, making a benefit from the feature is something different.There's a lot that we can do on our devices today that we haven't even unlocked yet.\"WASHINGTON -- The alien worlds known as \"super-Earths\" may be more like our own planet than previously thought, a new study suggests.Super-Earths -- exoplanets slightly larger than Earth -- are common throughout the Milky Way galaxy, but because of their massive gravity, scientists have assumed they should be water worlds.According to a new model, however, tectonically active super-Earths likely store most of their water in the mantle, leaving exposed continents and oceans that could create a stable climate such as that of Earth.\"The temperate climate on Earth is not just because of liquid water, but because of exposed continents,\" study researcher Nicolas Cowan of Northwestern University said here Tuesday (Jan. 7) at the 223rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society.The surface temperatures of continents act as a kind of geological thermostat, stabilizing the climate.[The Strangest Alien Planets (Gallery)]A super-Earth with twice the radius of Earth would have 10 times the mass and 10 times the amount of water as Earth.The big planet's gravity would be three times as large as Earth's, squashing the planet's topography by a factor of three and creating shallow ocean basins, researchers said.Given so much water and a shallow place to contain it, conventional wisdom holds that a super-Earth's oceans should overflow their basins and inundate the exoplanet.However, on Earth, a lot of water is stored in the mantle -- the rocky layer that makes up most of the planet's volume and mass -- and moves between the oceans and mantle as tectonic plates shift.Seafloor pressure, determined by gravity, controls this process.Cowan and colleagues modeled water storage on super-Earths, finding that the heftier gravity would create massive pressure on the seafloor, forcing water into the planet's mantle.\"We can put 80 times more water on a super-Earth and still have its surface look like Earth,\" Cowan said in a statement.As a result, these planets should have landmasses that stabilize the climate, instead of being submerged in oceans.If these planets, which are relatively common in the galaxy, turn out to have stable climates, their ability to support life as we know would be higher than previously thought.Of course, the gravity on such worlds is much greater -- perhaps three times as large -- but Cowan doesn't believe that rules out life.\"I don't think 3-G is a big problem for habitability,\" Cowan told SPACE.com, adding, \"fighter pilots can handle it.\"The researchers' model contains two major uncertainties, however.It assumes that super-Earths have plate tectonics, and it relies on estimates of the amount of water in Earth's mantle.The next step to confirm the model's findings would entail launching a high-contrast imaging mission in space to take pictures of these super-Earths and verify that they actually do have continents and oceans.\"Our model is a shot from the hip, but it' s an important step in advancing how we think about super-Earths,\" Cowan said.Global surface temperatures in 2013 were among the highest since scientists started keeping records in 1880.But federal agencies on Tuesday differed when putting last year's climate in historical context.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that 2013 tied with 2003 for the fourth warmest year.However, NASA said 2009 and 2006 tied for the seventh place.\"This is a real thing,\" Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientists for NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told Mashable.\"It doesn't go away because it's snowing in New York today.\"Schmidt said unequivocally that \"the planet is warming,\" and scientists are nearly 100% sure its attributable to human behavior to some degree.NOAA, in its report, noted that 2013 was the 37th consecutive year in which temperatures were above the 20th century average, and both agencies agreed that all 10 of the warmest years in the 133-year record have occurred since 1998.The agencies use \"slightly different methods\" to measure, according to NASA, \"but overall, their trends show close agreement.\"By the NOAA's measurements, the global combined land and ocean surface temperature in 2013 was 1.12 degrees above the 20th century average.NASA had it at 1.1 degrees.NASA further illustrated the warming trend with the graph below, combining NASA and NOAA measurements since 1880.\"This is something that's going to be with us for decades, if not centuries,\" Schmidt said.Australia, in particular, felt the heat in 2013.At 2.16 degrees above average by NOAA measurements, Australia experienced its warmest year since its national records began in 1910.That record might not last long, however, if January is any indication of things to come.Aussies sweated out temperatures as high as 117 degrees Fahrenheit just last week.As Schmidt and other climate scientists stress, one heat wave or one \"polar vortex\" does not necessarily mean climate change is occurring.\"Global warming is seen in the longterm trends,\" Schmidt said.\"It's not seen in this week's weather or last week's weather.\"The following NOAA map plots other significant climate events that occurred in 2013.(Click to enlarge)Check out the NASA and NOAA reports for more information on the climate in

former Vice-President Al Gore and former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.The two world figures commented on how extreme weather events are intensifying global awareness of the climate change phenomenon.The weather events they mentioned include the likes of the recent typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Sandy, both of which caused huge economic and human damage.“I think that these extreme weather events which are now a hundred times more common than 30 years ago are really waking people's awareness all over the world [on climate change], and I think that is a game changer, “ said Gore, as reported by The Guardian.\"Even with business leadership, we will need governmental actions, we need to put a price on carbon, we need to put a price on [climate change] denial in politics,\" he said.Bill Gates continued the conversation by raising the issue of how climate change and development are interlinked.When we talk about climate change, development problems around energy use and consumption should also take center stage.\"As the poorest are being lifted up, as they're getting lights and refrigerators, we are going to use more energy,\" said Gates.\"There's not a scenario here where we use less energy.We have to make the energy we use not emit any greenhouse gases, particularly CO2.\"Both men were part of a climate change panel at the World Economic Forum, joined by the likes of the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Erna Solberg, the Prime Minster of Norway, and other global leaders.The panel, titled \"Changing the Climate for Growth and Development,\" put climate change at the forefront of the nonprofit's annual meeting.The full discussion is embedded below.2014, increasingly becoming known as the “Climate Year” due to a United Nations summit on climate change at the General Assembly later this year, is already having its fair share of climate issues around the world.California's drought, possibly the worst in 100-years, is shedding new light on water scarcity issues, while the East Coast braced itself for a second polar vortex and snowstorm that showed no mercy with freezing temperatures and at least one death.On the other side of the world, Australia continues to deal with their intense summer heat, now with added risks to their drinking water.The increased awareness around climate change comes at a time when big profile names like Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh and various U.S. congressmen are still denying the very existence of any larger environmental pattern.They point to extremely cold weather events like the polar vortex as reasons why climate change appears to be a hoax.We are experiencing the coldest weather in more than two decades-most people never remember anything like this.GLOBAL WARMING anyone?— Donald J.

2014What people like Trump tend to leave out, the scientists indicate, is a key difference between climate change and weather: the measurement of time (more on that from NASA).Weather is an everyday event over a short period of time, whereas climate change is a larger weather trend over a much longer time-frame.It may feel cold outside right now, but NASA's new climate video helps you visualize how hot Earth is getting overall.NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) created the video, which colors the Earth based on air temperatures that rose or fell compared to historic averages.In 15 seconds, the video spans over 60 years of climate data from 1950 to 2013, and by the end, Earth is covered in hues of red and orange.The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is directly responsible for rising global temperatures.Earth's average temperature increased 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit in 63 years, reaching 58.3 degrees.If 1.1 degrees does not sound like much, consider that the planet's carbon-emission level is at its highest point in 800,000 years.Scientists have not recorded a year with cooler-than-average temperatures in 38 years, according to NASA.In other words, things haven't been getting colder overall since the Vietnam War ended, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier fought in Manila and Bill Gates started a company called Microsoft.2013 was a pretty warm year in the northern hemisphere -- it ranked 42nd in the United States' continental climate history.But things were much hotter in the southern hemisphere: Australia recorded its highest average temperature, according to NASA.GISS climatologist Gavin Schmidt said 2013 was another year that exemplified climate change.\"While one year or one season can be affected by random weather events, this analysis shows the necessity for continued, long-term monitoring,\" Schmidt said in a statement.Climate change has become a difficult concept for the general public to imagine, with an array of scenarios each affecting the world differently.The federal government, nonprofit groups and individuals have come up with visualization tools to help the public better understand the impacts that climate change may have not only on the world, but also at the local level.To help envision both current climate and weather patterns and the possible consequences that could occur due to climate change, here are eight tools that give a clearer understanding of the atmosphere.Do you have a favorite tool or map you like to use?Let us know in the comments.NASA and the Japan's space agency launched one of the most significant new weather and climate satellites in years on Thursday.Known as the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, or “GPM,\" the spacecraft is meant to provide scientists with a new global real-time view of rain and snowfall.It will take 3D snapshots of storms, including hurricanes, with data likely to start flowing by the beginning of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season on June 1.The satellite, which is a joint venture between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), launched shortly before 1:40 eastern time, and was broadcast live online.The satellite launched from tiny Tanegashima Island, on the southernmost corner of Japan.Mashable provided live coverage at @MashableLive, and additional information can be obtained via @NASA_Rain and NASA's website.Given that global warming is already increasing the intensity of precipitation in many parts of the world, there is an urgent need for scientists to have more reliable data across the globe.The GPM Core Observatory satellite will be used in concert with a broader network of partner satellites to obtain data on when, where and how much precipitation falls in certain spots around the world.It will also, for the first time, provide space-based estimates of snowfall.Currently, global measurements of precipitation are hampered by sparse data networks, particularly across Africa, and a lack of reliability over the oceans.According to a NASA , “The GPM mission will help advance our understanding of Earth's water and energy cycles, improve the forecasting of extreme events that cause natural disasters, and extend current capabilities of using satellite precipitation information to directly benefit society.”Live streaming video by UstreamThe GPM satellite program will extend space-based precipitation measurements worldwide, after 17 years of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or TRMM, satellite, which measures tropical rainfall.Unlike TRMM, the GPM network, which reportedly cost nearly $1 billion, will extent precipitation measurements from pole to pole.NASA says the GPM Mission also will help improve the monitoring and prediction of extreme weather events, including hurricanes, as well as droughts and floods.Apple CEO Tim Cook has not been known for taking a strong stand on, well, just about anything.Caution has been the watchword of Cook's three-year tenure at the top of the world's wealthiest technology company.So far his legacy is largely comprised of incremental improvements in established products, tweaks to the supply chain, and more corporate transparency.But Cook does care about the environment -- and that became very clear on Friday, when the CEO had a terse exchange with a lobbying group that is extremely skeptical on climate change.Apple has made vast improvements in its use of renewable energy since Cook took over from Steve Jobs.More than three-quarters of the company's facilities worldwide, including all of its data centers and its Cupertino HQ, now run on solar, wind, geothermal or hydro power, up from about a quarter under Jobs.Last year, Cook hired Lisa Jackson, former head of the EPA, to lead the company's sustainability efforts.None of that sits well with folks who don't think climate change is a big deal -- such as the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. and an Apple shareholder.The group calls climate change a \"chimera\" and claims that \"over 95 percent of all climate models have over-forecast the extent of predicted global warming.\"At the company's annual shareholder meeting in Cupertino, the NCPPR urged Cook and the board to pledge that Apple wouldn't pursue any more environmental initiatives that didn't improve its bottom line.\"We object to increased government control over company products and operations, and likewise mandatory environmental standards,\" wrote NCPPR general counsel Justin Danhof in a statement before the meeting.\"This is something [Apple] should be actively fighting, not preparing surrender.\"Danhof raised this question with Cook three times during the meeting.On the third time, clearly frustrated, Cook's response was blistering.First of all, he insisted, environmental efforts also make economic sense.Secondly, \"we do a lot of things for reasons besides profit motive,\" the CEO said:We do things because they are right and just and that is who we are.That’s who we are as a company.I don’t…when I think about human rights, I don’t think about an ROI.When I think about making our products accessible for the people that can’t see or to help a kid with autism, I don’t think about a bloody ROI, and by the same token, I don’t think about helping our environment from an ROI point of view.Anyone who had a problem with that approach?They should sell their Apple shares.\"If you only want me to make things, make decisions that have a clear ROI, then you should get out of the stock,\" Cook said to applause.Danhof's proposal was voted down by shareholders.It's a measure of the strength of Apple's position that Cook can afford to irritate such a large and powerful shareholder on a matter of principle.But it also offers hope for environmentalists frustrated by the lack of progress on climate change that -- in Apple's drought-ridden home state, at least -- now seems all too real.Greenpeace recently applauded Cook for working to reduce the number of \"conflict minerals\" in Apple products.Now it has one more reason to cheer.Editing note: this story was updated with quotes from a transcript of the meeting.An adage of U.S. politics has it that there is no clearer statement of a President’s priorities than his annual budget proposal.In unveiling the Fiscal Year 2015 budget proposal on Tuesday, President Obama made one thing abundantly clear: climate change is a high priority for the second year of his second term.The $3.9 trillion budget, delivered to Congress Tuesday morning, would boost federal spending on programs that make the U.S. more resilient to climate change-related impacts, such as droughts, heat waves and floods.While the budget stands little chance of passing Congress in its current form, it serves as a starting point for congressional Democrats in their negotiations with Republicans.The budget proposal would provide $2.5 billion for the U.S.Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which coordinates climate research across 13 federal agencies, from NASA to the Department of Agriculture.This would be $12 million more than the estimated spending level during Fiscal Year 2014, according to budget documents released by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.NASA, which oversees satellite observation platforms and computer modeling programs, would receive the largest share of USGCRP funding.As an example of NASA’s climate-related work, last week, the first of five earth observation satellites scheduled to be launched this year blasted off from a launch pad in Japan.The agency's Global Precipitation Measurement mission aims to provide scientists with an unparalleled view of the planet’s water cycle, which will add to their understanding of climate change.The budget proposal also includes a brand new $1 billion climate resilience fund meant to help communities across the country adapt to climate change impacts that are already occurring.Studies, including a major United Nations report released in 2014, have found that the 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average surface temperatures to date has already increased the odds of heavy precipitation events, heat waves, and coastal flooding in many areas.In a post on the White House website, three administration officials said the resilience fund is meant to make a difference in the near-term, while the country continues to work to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to manmade global warming.“We are not just seeing global increases in air and ocean temperatures, we are seeing changes across the United States: extended periods of unusual heat, a greater number of heavier downpours, more severe regional drought and wildfires in parts of the American West, permafrost thawing in Alaska, ocean acidification, and sea level rise threatening coastal communities,” wrote Michael Boots, who heads up the White House Council on Environmental Quality, along with White House Science advisor John Holdren and homeland security advisor Lisa Monaco.According to the Obama administration officials, the fund will provide $400 million to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for “additional hazard mitigation and preparedness efforts.” It will also help make America’s infrastructure more resilient to severe storms; for example, microgrid projects could make electricity service more reliable during extreme weather events.The fund would also help support new climate analysis efforts, including sea level rise mapping, the officials said.The budget would fully fund the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) weather and climate satellite programs at $2 billion.Some of these satellite programs are years behind schedule and billions over budget.According to several independent assessments, keeping the satellites on track for their projected launch dates is critical for ensuring the reliability of weather and climate forecasts, with a yearlong gap in polar satellite observations all but certain, according to the current timeline.This could temporarily diminish the accuracy of five-to-seven day weather forecasts.On the energy side, the budget would provide $5.2 billion in funding for clean energy technologies at the Department of Energy (DOE), including $325 million for the DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as ARPA-E.ARPA-E functions much like a private sector venture capital firm, investing in cutting edge, high-risk research endeavors that have the potential to transform the energy landscape.Overall, DOE would see an 8% increase in research funding compared to its estimated Fiscal Year 2014 level.The budget would also include a new tax credit to encourage investment in infrastructure that would support vehicles powered by natural gas, hydrogen gas, electric motors, or other fuels.The big energy story during the Obama administration has been the sharp increase in American oil and natural gas production through the use of advanced drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, also known as “fracking.” Last year, domestic oil production exceeded crude oil imports for the first time since 1996, according to the White House.The American oil and gas boom has had a dark side to it, with two major oil spills during the past three years, and an increase in rail-based oil shipments that have raised safety concerns.In addition, studies have shown that fracking may pose environmental health and safety problems.The 2015 budget would provide $48 million to support interagency research to examine health and safety issues associated with fracking.Standing eye level with oncoming lava, in a snow pit he is digging at Tolbachik volcano in Russia, Ben Edwards is hoping his world doesn't violently explode in the next few minutes.Several years of watching lava trundle over ice and snow has taught Edwards, a volcanologist at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, that he's probably safe — at this spot, the volcano's incandescent rock rarely sparked the kind of blasts typically seen when lava meets water.Finished with the snow pit, Edwards clambers out and waits for water to start trickling out of the deep walls.\"There was no obvious meltwater at Tolbachik, so we think the water drains immediately from the [lava-snow] interface, down under the snow,\" Edwards said.Understanding how snow-capped volcanoes generate meltwater will help scientists better predict flooding from so-called glaciovolcanic eruptions, a significant hazard.Among the worst natural disasters are massive floods from icy urban volcanoes such as Washington's Mount Rainer.In Iceland in 1996, a sudden flood called a jökulhlaup destroyed part of the national highway after Grímsvötn volcano melted its overlying glacier.But for Edwards, working at the extremes of fire and ice means more than predicting future hazards.He is also among a handful of geoscientists pioneering a new way to make sense of past ice ages — with volcanoes that erupted through ancient ice sheets.\"These are volcanoes with unique features that we can use to understand what's happened to Earth's climate over the last 10 to 15 million years,\" Edwards told Live Science's Our Amazing Planet.When fire meets iceMost of Earth's climate history comes from the ocean floor, from chemical signatures preserved in mud and microscopic sea creatures.Drilling into the seafloor rewards researchers with cores holding millions of years of natural temperature swings.(Even during an ice age, Earth's temperature shifts back and forth a little bit.)But matching these mucky cores to glacial advances and retreats on land is complicated by the glaciers themselves.Like giant erasers, glaciers scour away much of their record of past movement as they shrink and grow.In North America, only the last few glacial cycles can be found by geologic detectives.And the rubbly piles left behind may be impossible to pin down with an accurate age, which is key to matching glacial history to ocean climate records.Enter the weird volcanoes called tuyas.Tuyas are like little pushpins marking where and when ice covered the land.Though each tuya volcano may have erupted thousands of years apart, reconstructing their history is yielding new insight into the advance and retreat of continental ice sheets.\"They act as tide marks of vanished ice, and this information doesn't exist in any other form,\" said Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at the Open University in Scotland.Picture a volcano that looks like a towering bakery cake, with steep sides and a flat top.To those with a trained eye, the bottom layers obviously formed underwater.The rocks are bulbous pillow lavas and exploded lava glass, called hyaloclastite.But the frosting on top is a normal-looking lava flow, like those that cool in air.In the 1940s, a Canadian geologist first figured out how this strange stack of rocks appeared.The flat-topped volcano, called Tuya Butte, erupted underneath a long-gone ice sheet that once covered much of British Columbia.First, the volcanic heat thawed the ice, producing the bottom layers, called pillow lavas.As the ice thinned and a small meltwater lake formed, the overlying pressure lessened, and the lava had room to explode.\"One bit of basalt can melt about 10 to 14 times its own volume of ice, so you get a lot of water appearing very, very quickly during an eruption,\" McGarvie said.The confining ice kept everything piled up into a steep-sided hill.When the volcano was tall enough to burst through the ice sheet, the lava could cool in the air, creating the flat top.(If enough lava pours out, the volcano will build a traditional cone shape on top.)\"Imagine this amazing-looking island sitting in this moat of water surrounded by an ice wall,\" McGarvie said.\"When it all melts away, you're left with a flat-top mountain.\"Frozen in timeThe beauty of tuyas is that their hard rock preserves the height of the ice sheet, even though glaciers may grind away at the volcano.The transition from the waterline to aerial lavas is like the ring left on the inside of a bathtub.And tiny minerals in the lavas provide a precise age.\"Every time a volcano erupts it gives you a photograph of the ice,\" said John Smellie, a volcanologist at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.In western Canada, where scores of volcanoes erupted in the past millennia, geoscientists are quilting together the past thickness of the North American ice sheet with lava, and linking it to ocean cores.For example, ocean cores are often correlated by changes in oxygen isotopes (atoms with different numbers of neutrons) in ocean sediments.Edwards can now point to a volcano in British Columbia and say the ice on land was at least 985 feet thick during a certain marine isotope stage that corresponds to a cold Earth.\"With these volcanoes we have 2 million years of records,\" Edwards said.\"We have some volcanoes that erupted 10 to 15 times.It's not continuous, but we can start to think about whether the ice was always the same thickness,\" he said.\"This is important for people doing big-scale climate models, because there's really not much of a check on their models for ice sheets growing and disappearing.These kind of studies provide points that modelers can use, and they darn well better have ice that's a kilometer thick in B.C.volcanoes,\" Edwards said.In Iceland, where tuyas are called table mountains, glacier-volcano records can also provide a chronology of the ice sheets immediately south of the Arctic Circle, McGarvie said.More than half of Iceland's glaciers lie nearby or flow directly over volcanoes today.McGarvie is also scaling volcanoes in Chile to estimate the past thickness of tropical ice and link it to the marine climate record.Part of the Patagonian ice field, the glaciers were once more extensive and scientists think their expansion and contraction provides a sensitive record of past climate change.The original G-VAnd in Antarctica, home to most of Earth's glaciovolcanoes, past eruptions have resolved one of the thorniest ice sheet debates in recent decades, Smellie said.\"For 30 years people have argued for when the East Antarctic Ice Sheet made the transition from a relatively warm and movable ice sheet to its relatively cold and stable state,\" Smellie told Live Science's Our Amazing Planet.Why does this matter?An ice sheet with a warm bottom can respond more quickly to a warming climate, meaning East Antarctica's massive glaciers might soon shift into fast-flowing mode, rapidly raising sea levels.Smellie and his colleagues looked at the ice sheet's past history during warmer and colder climate swings by examining volcanic rocks in Victoria Land, which includes a large segment of the Transantarctic Mountains, the range the separates East and West Antarctica.\"There are a lot of unique features about volcanoes that erupt under ice sheets, and we can determine how warm [the base of] that ice sheet was,\" Smellie said.They discovered that neither side was right.East Antarctica wasn't exclusively warm or cold in the past 12 million years.Instead, the base of the ice sheet was a patchwork throughout its history.The findings were published in January 2014 in the journal Geology.\"[East Antarctica] is not liable to collapse if the world increases in temperature by 3 degrees Celsius,\" (or 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), Smellie said.Growing interestWhile glaciovolcanism is attracting growing interest from scientists, its experts say there is much work to be done in exploring and explaining volcano-ice interactions.At Tolbachik, Edwards was studying a modern volcano to better interpret the strange shapes that formed when Canada's volcanoes erupted beneath glaciers.Lava freezes into amazing patterns when it flows on, under and next to ice and snow, and modern eruptions offer clues to how these patterns form.\"Most of my career is trying to do forensic studies, so it is very, very instructive to actually watch the lavas go into the ice and watch the textures form,\" Edwards said.\"I think we're on the cusp of a big burst of people starting to really take apart these old volcanoes,\" Edwards added.\"There are a lot of places where no one has looked at these deposits.\"Smellie hopes the burgeoning field will someday provide better constraints on climate models.About 30 Senate Democrats, including all four members of the Democratic leadership, plan to take to the Senate floor for an all-night “talk-a-thon” on climate change, starting at 7 p.m. Monday.Led by Democratic Sens.Brian Schatz and Barbara Boxer of California, the event is an effort to raise awareness of the issue and bolster support for the White House’s push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by regulating power plants, among other measures.The president’s climate policies have come under harsh criticism from Republicans, who have accused the White House of “waging a war on coal.”The event is not a formal filibuster, since Democrats are not discussing any specific legislation, but they plan to hold the floor from the completion of voting on Monday until regular Senate business resumes on Tuesday morning at 9, according to a statement from Sen. Schatz’s office.One member of the task force, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D.-R.I.) has given 60 floor speeches on climate change since his election in 2006.“Climate change is real, it is caused by humans, and it is solvable,” said Senator Schatz in a statement.“Congress must act.On Monday night we’re going to show the growing number of Senators who are committed to working together to confront climate change.”\"The cost of Congress' inaction on climate change is too high for our communities, our kids and grandkids, and our economy,” Senator Whitehouse said.“On Monday we’ll be sending a clear message: it’s time for Congress to wake up and get serious about addressing this issue.”Top 4 members of Senate leadership (@SenatorReid, @SenatorDurbin, @SenSchumer + @PattyMurray) will participate in #climatechange session.— Anthony Adragna (@AnthonyAdragna) March 10, 2014Democrats are highlighting the issue at a time when many Republicans have been expressing their doubt that manmade climate change is a reality, despite the scientific consensus on the issue.According to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.-K.Y.), who is running for reelection in what is expected to be a close race, scientists are still divided on the causation of global warming.\"For everybody who thinks it's warming, I can find somebody who thinks it isn't,\" McConnell told the Cincinnatti Enquirer over the weekend.McConnell has criticized the Obama administration’s environmental policies, saying they're hostile to the coal industry, which has a significant presence in his state.The upcoming 2014 midterm elections may explain why some Democrats are staying away from the talk-a-thon.For example, Democratic Sen. Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana is not expected to take part in the event, and she has been vocal in her support of the Keystone XL pipeline, which many environmentalists are fighting against.The pipeline would deliver oil from the Canadian oil sands in Alberta to the refineries along the Gulf of Mexico, where most of it would be exported to foreign markets.Opponents say it would increase greenhouse gas emissions and pose risks to public and environmental health, and they are pressuring the White House to reject the project.Other Democrats in tight races, including Sens.Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, are also missing from the list of expected speakers.A majority of Senate Democrats, with the notable exception of several senators who are facing tough re-election fights in November, pulled an all-nighter on Monday to highlight the dangers of global climate change.Senators and environmental groups said the climate talk-a-thon, which was only the 35th time the Senate has ever held an all-night session, was aimed at raising awareness of the issue, voicing support for the White House’s strategy of using the U.S. EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and rallying the base of the party to get behind efforts to combat global warming.The night was filled with speeches, rather than votes, because no major climate bill is currently on the agenda -- and even the Democrats are not completely unified on which solutions to pursue.After all, it was Democratic disunity that helped doom the 2009 climate bill that passed the House, more than Republican opposition.The speeches included buzzwords like the polar vortex, and senators trotted out their favorite climate change analogies, such as how global warming ups the odds of extreme weather events in a similar way to how steroids increase the odds of home runs in baseball.For their part, Republicans took the opportunity Monday to continue voicing skepticism about the findings of the vast majority of climate scientists, who have shown that manmade emissions of greenhouse gases are warming the climate.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein cited studies showing that sea level rise could cause Californians to lose 450,000 homes, 30 coastal power plants and dozens of hospitals by 2100.“This could all be inundated by the end of the century,” she said.“Bottom line: Rising seas puts Californian homes, public facilities and environmental resources in great peril and adapting to these changes will impose great costs.”Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine spoke of friends who live in historic homes in Hampton Roads, which along with Norfolk, Va., plays host to the largest concentration of U.S. Navy assets anywhere in the world.There, historic homes considered safe from coastal flooding are experiencing frequent episodes of inundation, Kaine said.The Hampton Roads area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions to sea level rise because of the combination of sinking land, known as land subsidence, and rising seas.This results in a regional hotspot of sea level rise.Clip from C-Span showing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-N.V.) beginning the all-night climate talk-a-thon on March 10, 2014.Kaine spoke out against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from the Canadian oil sands of Alberta to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico, where most of it would be shipped abroad.Proponents argue the pipeline would create jobs and tap oil that will be exploited with or without the pipeline, while opponents say it would add to greenhouse gas emissions and poses serious public and environmental health risks.Because the pipeline would cross an international boundary at the Canadian border, the White House has final approval of the project.An announcement on the Obama administration’s decision is expected sometime this year.“It would be very good thing if the president right now rejected the use of tar sands oil in the Keystone pipeline,” Kaine said.“Why would we embrace tar sands oil and backslide to a dirtier tomorrow?”Mark Warner, the other Virginia Democrat in the Senate, sat out the event.Warner is up for reelection this year.The lack of any legislation for senators to rally around was the elephant in the Senate chamber -- or rather, the elephant not in the chamber.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who on Monday night made his 60th climate change floor speech since his election in 2006, said the event was aimed at creating momentum within the Democratic party, which has had internal fissures on the issue, and pressuring the Republicans to act as well.Behind the scenes at #Up4Climate: Senators preparing for tonight’s speeches.pic.twitter.com/3cT8kEp7GA— Sheldon Whitehouse (@SenWhitehouse) March 10, 2014“We have got a little bit more work to do to open up the political space on this.I think if we want immediately to a vote we wouldn’t be successful,” Whitehouse said, according to The Guardian.“If we make this an issue in 2014, if we make this a debate that Republican presidential candidates have to address, I think we can do that.”The White House took part in the event via its social media accounts.Sea level rise exacerbated by climate change increases the frequency & severity of coastal flooding → http://t.co/yllOGisuqd #Up4Climate— The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 11, 2014RT if you agree: For the sake of our kids & the future of our planet, it's time to #ActOnClimate change.#Up4Climate pic.twitter.com/wCJHkCMtXV— The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 10, 2014Republicans dismissed the talk-a-thon as a gimmick designed to support an unpopular issue.Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the most prominent climate skeptic in the Senate (he's even writing a book on the subject) took to the floor at the start of the night to mock the Democrats’ efforts.\"It's probably necessary to have something that's all night, because you keep saying and I hear it over and over, 'Climate change is real, it's real, it's real,'\" he said.\"Maybe if you keep saying it's real, people will believe it.\"Dems effort is cause for some confusion BC these senators are calling 4 action in a chamber they control\"#Up4Climate http://t.co/wjOPZrgTvk— Inhofe Press Office (@InhofePress) March 10, 2014Robert Cowin, the director of government affairs for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a research and advocacy group, told Mashable that the event was successful at raising awareness and drawing attention to climate change at a time when there is no legislation to rally around.“People can relate to the fact that they were actually there all night, that actually means more than just going down to the floor to speak,” Cowin told Mashable.“It’s important to build that coalition so that when the opportunity does present itself … there will already be that kind of organization and momentum to get to the finish line.”According to Cowin, the floor speeches clarified that senators are aware of how climate change is already affecting their states, such as by lengthening the wildfire season and leading to larger fires in states like New Mexico and California.In its Fiscal Year 2015 budget proposal, the White House is seeking $1 billion for a new climate resilience fund to help communities cope with extreme events and better prepare for future events, and Cowin said the talk-a-thon demonstrated that such a plan could garner Senate support.“The Senate is really looking for something to rally around,” he said.“We need to make climate resilience a national priority.”The Obama administration is teaming up with tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Intel to roll out web-based tools for policy makers and the public to better understand likely climate change impacts in their communities.The White House announced its climate data initiative, which is part of the administration's broader \"Climate Action Plan\" unveiled in June 2013, on Wednesday morning.The centerpiece of the initiative is a new climate data portal that launched in a beta phase as part of the data.gov website -- climate.data.gov.This portal features climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA, as well as other federal agencies, universities, and nonprofits, in a bid to make \"federal data about our climate more open, accessible, and useful to citizens, researchers, entrepreneurs, and innovators.\"The first topic to be addressed on climate.data.gov is going to be coastal flooding and sea level rise risks.According to a White House fact sheet distributed to reporters, the website already includes more than 100 curated datasets, web services, and tools that can help communities plan for climate change impacts.\"Over time, these data and resources will expand to provide information on other climate-relevant threats, such as to human health, energy infrastructure, and our food supply,\" the fact sheet said.The release of climate data comes out of a recognition that the impacts of climate change are already being felt across the U.S., particularly in the form of more frequent and severe heat waves, wildfires, and heavy precipitation events.In addition, sea level rise is an increasing threat to coastal communities, especially in cities like New York, Norfolk, Miami and New Orleans.The Obama administration may also be betting that there will be more support for its actions to reduce the severity of climate change through measures such as EPA regulations of power plants if more data reaches the public's fingertips.The climate data initiative will be publicly unveiled at an event in Washington on Wednesday evening.Prior to this effort, climate science data has been buried in bureaucratic stovepipes at more than a dozen federal agencies, ranging from NASA to the Department of Defense.Even within a single agency, multiple sub-departments have maintained different datasets, making it nearly impossible for policy makers and the public to access.For example, NOAA runs the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., which is the official repository of U.S. climate data, but NOAA's climate research is led by a separate division, as is the agency's short-to-medium range climate forecasting.The White House framed its climate data push as an integral component of the president's emphasis on boosting America's resilience in the face of extreme weather and climate events, which have cost the country record amounts in recent years.\"Even as we work to curb greenhouse-gas emissions and expand renewable energy generation, we need to take steps to make our communities more resilient to the climate change impacts we can't avoid -- some of which are well underway,\" said John Podesta, a counselor to the president and one of the top aides working on climate issues in the West Wing, and presidential Science Advisor John P. Holdren, in a White House blog post.\"This effort will help give communities across America the information and tools they need to plan for current and future climate impacts,\" they said.The open climate data push includes a NASA and NOAA \"innovation challenge\" to foster the development of coastal flooding tools.In addition, the initiative is also involving agencies not normally thought of as having much to do with climate science, such as the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, which is part of the Defense Department.That intelligence agency, along with others, is releasing new map data of U.S. infrastructure, including bridges, roads, railroad tunnels, canals, and river gauges.Foremost among the private sector climate data initiatives highlighted by the White House is Google's commitment to donate a petabyte, which is equal to 1,000 terabytes, of cloud computing storage to help support the creation of high-resolution maps and data crunching tools that are available to the public.According to the White House, Google is also announcing partnerships with university scientists to donate as many as 50 million hours of high performance cloud computing on the Google Earth Engine geospatial analysis platform.The company is also committing to helping to develop a new, ultra-high resolution global terrain model that could greatly improve flood risk analysis.In addition to Google's work, mapmaker CartoDB is announcing new grants for creating climate data-driven tools that would use CartoDB's infrastructure.Another mapmaker, Esri, which makes the widely used ArcGIS software used by city planners, is also donating some of its resources to encourage climate science-relation innovation.Esri launched a climate-focused \"geo-collaboration portal\" on Wednesday, where citizens and professionals can go online to discover, contribute, and share resources critical to confronting the impacts of climate change.“We felt it was important to establish this collaborative network of individuals and organizations who use GIS to come together to combat the impacts of climate change,” said Esri president Jack Dangermond in a statement.Also, Microsoft Research is also providing climate scientists and policy makers with free access to some of their cloud computing resources, in the form of grants to 40 awardees.Each grant would provide up to 180,000 hours of free cloud computing time and 20 terabytes of cloud storage.Microsoft is also rolling out a new data resource called \"Adaptable FetchClimate,\" for accessing past and present climate observations and for climate projection information.The White House is also partnering with the Intel Corporation, which will host regional hackathons to spur the development of climate resilience tools.Nonprofit groups are also part of the White House's climate resilience strategy.Climate Central, a nonprofit climate news and research organization, is planning to release new online tools to assess local sea level rise risks.\"Today Climate Central is committing to launch a next-generation sea level rise and coastal flood risk tool for every state in the U.S. We have already published prototypes for New York, New Jersey, and Florida.We'll be releasing a major tool upgrade for those states next week, and then releasing tools for all other coastal states over the spring and summer,\" Ben Strauss, director of Climate Central's sea level rise program, told Mashable.[wp_scm_comment]The Showtime documentary series \"Years of Living Dangerously,\" executive produced by James Cameron, features an exclusive interview with Barack Obama, Mashable has learned -- a segment that may provide rare insight into the President's thinking on climate science and policy.The interview was taped during the week of March 16, individuals with knowledge of the segment said.The show premieres April 13.While he has given speeches on climate change, including one address in June at which he rolled out the administration's Climate Action Plan, Obama has not given lengthy interviews solely on this subject.The White House has not responded to a request for comment.The interview is in keeping with the mission of the series, which is to take a science-based deep dive into the multifaceted threats climate change poses, as well as the array of available solutions.The series, which was funded in part by Cameron, was shot in far-flung locations as varied as the Greenland ice sheet, Indonesia, and the burning forests of the American West.Episodes feature celebrity correspondents including former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also is credited as a producer, Matt Damon, Ian Somerhalder, Jessica Alba, and TV newscasters Chris Hayes of MSNBC and Leslie Stahl of CBS' 60 Minutes.The show will be the highest profile program on climate change since Al Gore's Academy Award-winning documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth.\"Cameron and veteran film executive Jerry Weintraub served as executive producers of the show, which was co-created by former \"60 Minutes\" producers David Gelber and Joel Bach.In what is likely a first for a Showtime series, the program's content was vetted by a panel of nine climate scientists, including Joe Romm of the Center for American Progress and Climate Progress blog, Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University, and Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University.The effects of man-made climate change, from sea-level rise to increasingly acidic ocean waters, have already become starkly apparent throughout the world.These effects are poised to worsen dramatically in coming decades due to continued emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, according to a major new scientific report released on Sunday.The report, which is the second installment of a three-part series of scientific updates from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sharply warns that climate change poses the greatest risks to the most vulnerable populations within all nations, and a potentially existential risk to poorer countries already struggling with food insecurity and civil conflict, as well as low-lying small island states.According to the report, climate change is likely to ratchet up the amount of stress being placed on natural and human systems, to the point where increased loss of species is likely, along with increasingly frequent breakdowns in the functioning of human society.In particular, the report cites the effects increased temperatures and heat waves have on essential food crops -- in most cases lowering productivity -- and warns of food availability and price swings that could lead to civil unrest in countries that are already having problems meeting the basic needs of their citizens.Climate change has already begun to hold back wheat and maize yields, the report found.“Global temperature increases of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more above late-20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security globally and regionally,” the report said.The report says that the world is ill-prepared to manage the risks from a changing climate, and that if warming proceeds along the high end of the possible range of outcomes, climate change may overwhelm even the most well-prepared and wealthy nations.It paints a bleak picture of a hotter, more unstable future in which the combination of climate change and population growth combine to overwhelm the capacity of natural and human systems, resulting in increased poverty, conflict, and species extinction.Societies can adapt to some of these impacts, the report says, but not all -- especially if the amount and rate of warming during the 21st century turns out to be close to a worst-case scenario.“With high levels of warming that result from continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, risks will be challenging to manage, and even serious, sustained investments in adaptation will face limits,” said Chris Field, a scientist at the Carnegie Institution in California, who co-chaired the working group that produced the report.“We’re not in an era where climate change is some sort of future hypothetical,” Field told reporters on Sunday.“There is no question that we live in a world that’s already altered by climate change.”The report, which is the product of more than 300 lead authors and hundreds more contributing authors, focuses on climate change impacts as well as opportunities to adapt to a changing climate and reduce the global community’s vulnerability to climate change-related impacts.Such impacts include heavy precipitation events and coastal flooding.In many cases, we are not prepared for the climate-related risks that we already face.This report is part of the fifth major assessment of climate science from the IPCC, which is an intergovernmental body tasked with reviewing the state of climate science every several years, and issuing reports meant to inform policymakers.The first part of this latest IPCC assessment, on the physical evidence of climate change, was published in September 2013.That report found that there is at least 95% certainty that humans have \"been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\"It also projected global average surface temperatures are likely to exceed 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, and will likely range from 0.54 degrees Fahrenheit to 8.64 degrees Fahrenheit above 1986-2005 levels, depending on the sensitivity of the climate as well as the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.With this new report, the IPCC states that climate change is best viewed as a risk management challenge.It also states with increased confidence that one of the significant risks related to climate change is more or worsened civil conflict.\"We live in an era of man-made climate change,\" said Vicente Barros, a professor at the University of Buenos Aires and co-chair of the IPCC working group that produced the report.\"In many cases, we are not prepared for the climate-related risks that we already face.Investments in better preparation can pay dividends both for the present and for the future.\"The IPCC report draws its conclusions from an exhaustive review of peer reviewed scientific papers published since the group’s fourth assessment report was released in 2007.According to the new report’s summary for policymakers, which was approved by government representatives and scientists meeting in Yokohama, Japan during the past week, the number of scientific publications pertaining to climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerability more than doubled between 2005 and 2010, reflecting the increased interest in the topic and the broad and sweeping changes observed in the climate system during that time period.The findings make clear that vulnerability to climate change and exposure to its impacts varies in large part based on non-climatic factors, such as economic and political development.Poorer countries generally have more risk exposure and less capacity to adapt to climate change than wealthy nations, the report said.The IPCC panel also found that evidence of climate change impacts is already being seen throughout the natural world, where species are shifting their ranges in order to keep up with a warming climate, and some species are dying out at a faster rate.The IPCC report advises that climate change adaptation work needs to be pursued simultaneously with efforts to slash emissions, pointing to data showing that long-term warming will largely be determined by the amount of greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere during the next few decades.At the same time, the world is virtually guaranteed to experience continued climate change impacts during the next few decades due to the greenhouse gases that were previously emitted.Each molecule of carbon dioxide, which is the most important long-lived manmade greenhouse gas, can remain in the atmosphere for as many as 1,000 years, making it more urgent to cut emissions in the near future, or face continued cumulative warming for centuries to come.The new report underscores the urgency of the task before policymakers around the world -- take potentially expensive actions now to reduce emissions in order to avoid the worst effects of global warming years down the road.\"Climate change has already delivered severe economic damage and things will only get worse without more action,\" said Andrew Steer, the president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based think tank, in a press statement.\"The report makes it clear that deep and rapid cuts in emissions can greatly reduce the costs of these impacts.Taking action now will undoubtedly be less expensive than waiting.\"As previous reports have warned, this IPCC assessment found that higher levels of warming would increase the risks of \"severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts\" from global warming, including species extinction and the loss of massive polar ice sheets that could raise global average sea levels by more than two feet.The combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is projected to compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors.The report singles out coastal areas, including low-lying island nations, as hot spots of elevated risk that may not be completely manageable due to the steady climb in global sea levels projected to take place during the rest of this century, as the planet warms and land-based ice sheets melt.\"Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts that, in some cases, could have associated damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of GDP,\" the report said.Coastal areas and nations dependent upon fishing for food and revenue are likely to suffer as well, the report said, with broad changes in marine species richness and fisheries catch potential as warming and increasingly acidic seas cause species to move to different parts of the ocean.Oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.The report sheds light on two contentious areas of climate impact studies, although it does not provide the definitive last word.In terms of the likely economic consequences of climate change, it found that additional temperature increases of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (compared to late 20th century temperatures) would cause global annual economic losses of between 0.2 to 2% of income, with losses more likely to be on the higher end of the scale.\"Losses accelerate with greater warming,\" the report found.Regarding human health impacts, the report found that through the middle of this century, most of the effects of climate change will be seen through the worsening of preexisting health problems, rather than the emergence of new diseases or spread of diseases to new areas.At the high-end scenario of global warming, in which global average temperatures increase to 8.46 degrees Fahrenheit above 1986-2005 average levels by 2100, the report found that \"the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is projected to compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors.\"The latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released on Sunday night, is both sweeping in scope and staggering for its unprecedented details on the impacts of global climate change to date, as well as potential future effects on human and natural systems.The report depicts a planet already adjusting to increasingly apparent manifestations of climate change, from melting polar ice caps and rising seas to more severe and frequent heat waves.While the report summary runs a mere 44 pages, the full chapters are far more dense and data-rich, and they amount to a summation of almost everything that scientists have learned about the impacts of manmade changes of the climate system and how such changes may alter human society and the natural world.In an effort to tease out some of the more important findings, Mashable scoured the technical summary as well as other chapters and highlighted seven of the most important findings.1.Climate change is not a farmer's best friendClimate change is already dragging down crop yields, a trend that is likely to continue at the same time that population growth ensures that food demand will be rising, the report found.The report is extremely specific when it comes to future crop yields, stating that, regardless of adaptation efforts, climate change will reduce median crop yields by up to 2% per decade through 2100, when compared to a world without climate change.At the same time as crop yields will be challenged, crop demand will be rising by about 14% per decade until 2050, the IPCC said.“Risks are greatest for tropical countries, given projected impacts that exceed adaptive capacity and higher poverty rates compared with temperate regions,” the report found.So far at least, climate change is having a small impact on rice and soybean yields around the world, but it has been depressing wheat and maize yields.Extreme heat events can significantly reduce crop yields, particularly when temperatures soar to or above 86 degrees Fahrenheit during the growing season.With an increase in global average surface temperatures comes higher odds of heat waves.Extreme heat events in Russia in 2010 and the Midwest U.S. in 2012 proved that such events can lead to sharp and rapid food price swings.The IPCC said there are measures that can be taken to help crops adapt to climate change, which would improve crop yields by about 15% to 18% of current yields, but adaptation capabilities vary from region to region and would lose effectiveness if warming is at the higher-end of projections.2.We no longer have a choice between reducing the severity of climate change and adapting to its impacts.Climate change is here, and we have to do both.Because of the long atmospheric lifetime of some of the main greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, there is a mismatch between the payoff from climate change mitigation, which involves reducing emissions of planet warming greenhouse gases to lessen to severity of climate change, and climate change adaptation, which refers to measures to better withstand the impacts of climate change.It used to be that these two categories were discussed separately (if adaptation was even brought up at all).But that has changed as the impacts of climate change have emerged in plain sight over the past several years.“We’re not in an era where climate change is some sort of future hypothetical,” said IPCC working group co-chairman Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution in California, during a Sunday evening press conference.“There is no question that we live in a world that’s already altered by climate change.”Cutting emissions now can dramatically curtail the ultimate impacts of climate change starting in the middle of this century, but until then, we’re going to have to deal with the effects of climate change already baked into the climate system.3.It's unfair, but poor and other vulnerable populations will suffer the most from climate change.A common thread throughout the report is that poor nations, particularly developing countries in and near the tropics, as well as poor and vulnerable populations within wealthy nations, are likely to suffer the most severe climate change-related consequences.Not only that, but global warming will introduce new roadblocks to escaping poverty.According to the report:Throughout the 21st century, climate change impacts will slow down economic growth and poverty reduction, further erode food security, and trigger new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger.The fact that climate change is likely to deal its harshest blows to less developed nations is one of the cruel ironies about this issue -- considering that it was largely the rich, industrialized world that emitted the greenhouse gases that caused the problem in the first place.4.Higher-end warming scenarios show far greater risks of triggering “tipping points.”The report repeatedly warns that risks associated with a global average surface temperature rise of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or higher would take the planet in a far riskier direction than if warming were to be contained below that level.“Large magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and challenging impacts,” the report said.An unsettling fact about climate science is that researchers know that in the past, the Greenland ice sheet, and parts of Antarctica too, have melted rapidly after the climate reached a certain point.However, scientists don’t know exactly what that tipping point is (they just know it would be a bad idea to reach it).The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points (critical thresholds) remain uncertain, but the likelihood of crossing tipping points in the earth system or interlinked human and natural systems decreases with reduced greenhouse gas emissions (medium confidence).Sustained warming greater than some threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a global mean sea-level rise of up to 7 meters [23 feet] (high confidence).Current estimates place this threshold somewhere between 3.6 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit of warming compared to preindustrial levels.5.Global warming will be harmful to the economy.The report found that if global warming reaches 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming above pre-industrial levels, it could lead to “global aggregate economic losses” of between 0.2% and 2.0% of GDP.This estimate is conservative, though, as economic impact estimates are “incomplete and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable,” the report said.However, there is little to no evidence showing that global warming won’t be costly, rather, the challenge lies in figuring out just how expensive it might be.6.Global warming is likely to lead to increased water stressOne of the most well-known effects of global warming is an intensification of the water cycle, with higher air temperatures leading to increased evaporation from the seas and soils, and more atmospheric water vapor contributing to more frequent heavy precipitation events.Paradoxically, climate change is projected to bring both more heavy rainstorms and more droughts, as dry regions get drier and wet areas get wetter, overall.But the new report sheds light on the broad consequences of global warming on renewable freshwater resources, finding that each degree of warming will decrease renewable water resources by at least 20% for an additional 7% of the global population.In other words, the warmer it gets, the more people who will be thirsty.7.Sea-level rise and storms will combine to flood coastal cities and force millions from their homes.One of the most dire findings in the entire report concerns the impacts of sea level rise and coastal flooding in rapidly growing areas of coastal Asia.According to the IPCC, “hundreds of millions of people” will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced by loss of their land, most of then in East, Southeast and South Asia.“Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts and associated annual damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of GDP,” the report said.Sea level rise has already amplified storm surge-related coastal flooding in the U.S. and around the world.For example, Hurricane Sandy brought a record storm tide to New York City in October 2013, flooding more areas than otherwise would have been inundated, since the sea level in lower Manhattan had climbed by about a foot during the 20th century.A study published earlier this year found that coastal flooding could affect nearly 5% of the global population on an annual basis, with expected yearly losses of up to 9.3% of GDP by the year 2100, unless significant actions are taken to better protect low-lying urban areas.On the same day that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its new report warning that global warming will raise the risks of a host of potentially costly and deadly consequences, from sea level rise to food supply disruptions, Exxon Mobil Corp. released its own set of climate reports.As one might expect from the world’s most profitable corporation and one of the largest oil companies, Exxon’s documents, published Monday, struck a different tone from the IPCC.Exxon’s reports to its shareholders amount to an unprecedented disclosure of how the company views its risk exposure to climate change, specifically to potential greenhouse gas emissions reduction mandates that would curb oil and gas use between now and the year 2040.The company told its shareholders -- some of whom spent years trying to get the company to disclose its climate-related risks -- that it does not need to plan for aggressive carbon emissions cuts before 2040, because governments are unlikely to impose such expensive regulations.Exxon cited a report by the International Energy Agency, which found that it would cost up to $45 trillion to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to 50% below 2005 levels by 2050.This finding is striking because, as the IPCC said, just such aggressive emissions cuts are required in order for the world to limit manmade global warming below dangerous levels.In fact, while it acknowledged that its operations face some risks related to climate change policies, and that the company favors governmental action to reduce the severity of climate change, Exxon said its plans call for all of its oil and gas reserves to be exploited for generating electricity and powering transportation, among other uses, through 2040.Therefore, the company said, none of its oil and gas reserves are at risk of becoming “stranded assets.”Instead, these stores will be processed and ultimately burned, releasing more planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.“The risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action,” said William Colton, Exxon's vice president of corporate strategic planning, in a press release.However, Exxon said it is prioritizing the need to meet the world’s growing energy demands through its oil and gas products, rather than addressing climate change, during the next several decades.“All of ExxonMobil's current hydrocarbon reserves will be needed, along with substantial future industry investments, to address global energy needs,” Colton said.If all of Exxon’s oil and gas reserves were to be exploited, that would release at least 7.01 gigatons of carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas, based on 2013 data the group Fossil Free Indexes provided to Mashable.By comparison, all the fossil fuels burned in the U.S. in 2013 released about 5.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide, according to the Energy Information Agency.And other estimates of the carbon dioxide emissions that would result from burning Exxon’s massive reserves are significantly higher, including a figure of 40 gigatons calculated by the environmental group 350.org.“Exxon basically says, ‘we hear you about this climate change thing, we’re just not going to do anything about it,’” said Brett Fleishman, a 350.org senior analyst, in an email to Mashable.“Maybe that’s because, for the last decade, Exxon has remained at the top of the owners list of potential carbon dioxide held by fully public companies.”In the reports and the press release, Exxon touted its investments in climate research, efficiency improvements within the company, and the company’s participation in “constructive dialogue on policy options.”Until 2012, the company was one of the largest funders of organizations that deny the existence and severity of manmade global warming, such as the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, which is a free-market think tank.No need to plan for a low carbon scenarioIn its climate reports, Exxon ruled out the possibility that its leaders would seek to meet the IPCC’s low-carbon development scenario, which would limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels.The global community, including the United States, agreed to that temperature target at a 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, but since then emissions have continued to track far above the path that would be needed to meet that target.Exxon says trying to meet the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit target would be too costly, and it does not foresee a government-mandated commitment to do so.Instead, it foresees emissions growing along a mid-range scenario, which would yield warming of between about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit compared to preindustrial levels by 2100.Furthermore, the company said its oil and gas reserves are too important for lifting millions of people worldwide out of poverty, particularly in the developing world.“... We are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become ‘stranded,’ the company’s report said.“We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide, and in preventing consumers -- especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable economies -- from themselves becoming stranded in the global pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic opportunity.”According to Exxon’s scenario for global development through 2040, the world will require about 35% more energy in 2040 compared to 2010, the majority of which would still come from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas.“Increasing energy costs leads to a scarcity of affordable, reliable and accessible energy and can additionally lead to social instability,” the report said.In its new report, the IPCC warned that climate change itself will raise the risk of social instability and could help drive conflicts in already unstable parts of the world, such as the Middle East.Andrew Logan, who directs the oil and gas program at Ceres, a group that advocates changing market practices to incorporate long-term risks like climate change, said the reports are a positive step for Exxon but discouraging at the same time.“Ultimately it’s not up to Exxon how the world deals with climate change,” he told Mashable.“We strongly disagree with some of the company’s sense of the likelihood of global action.” In other words, in Logan's view, world leaders are likely to act more aggressively to curb climate change than Exxon anticipates.Logan said it’s notable that the IPCC said on Monday that climate change jeopardizes economic growth, yet Exxon took the opposite view by saying that addressing climate change too aggressively would do the same thing.On Sunday, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the final installment of a massive report laying out just how feasible it is for the global community to limit manmade global warming to below dangerous levels.Like the previous two installments, published in September of last year and March, this report contains extremely dense, technical material.Yet its contents are hugely important for the public and policymakers.It lays out the case for why drastic emissions cuts are needed, starting within the next decade, in order to have a decent chance of limiting the amount -- and the pace -- of global warming.First, here's the good news from the report.Meeting the target of keeping global warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels can be done -- if we take action now.Here's a breakdown of some of the latest report's most important findings.The window of opportunity to avert a \"dangerous\" amount of global warming is rapidly closing: We have just about a decade left to bend the upward curve of greenhouse gas emissions.Attempts to reduce emissions significantly so far have not succeeded.#IPCC : “Clear message from science: To avoid dangerous interference with climate system, we need to move away from business as usual.”— WMO | OMM (@WMOnews) April 14, 2014The longer we wait, the fewer options we will have: After 2030, for example, many of the more than 1,000 policy scenarios the scientists examined would not succeed in limiting manmade global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or less, which is the goal that world leaders agreed to during the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009.In other words, the world will have fewer options available the longer we wait to cut emissions.We're definitely on the wrong track: The world is on course to see an increase in global average surface temperatures of up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century.This could have disastrous consequences by dramatically raising global sea levels, melting land-based ice sheets, and leading to more heat waves and extreme precipitation events, among other impacts.We are already seeing climate change impacts worldwide, including the increased likelihood and severity of some extreme weather events like heat waves and heavy precipitation events, and the global average surface temperature has increased by just 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit since 1901.#IPCC #climatesolutions press conf -- emissions have grown over past decade despite mitigation efforts and economic crisis.— IPCC (@IPCC_CH) April 13, 2014We already have most of the technologies we need: We don't need to -- in fact we shouldn't -- wait for some miracle technological solution to climate change, since tools to burn energy more cleanly and use energy more efficiently already exist.However, in most climate scenarios, carbon capture and storage technology needs to be employed to bring emissions to lower levels.Such technology, which would capture carbon dioxide emissions before it escapes a power plant and bury it deep underground, is not yet proven on a commercial scale.Emisions cuts may not break the bank: Although economic studies of how much it will cost to minimize global warming vary, but the study says that aggressive emissions cuts would only shave off between 0.04% and 0.14% from consumption growth during the century.Emissions need to trend in the opposite direction, ASAP: Total manmade greenhouse-gas emissions were the highest in human history from 2000 to 2010, and reached 49 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2010.The vast majority of that, or about 78%, has come from burning fossil fuels for energy, with smaller amounts coming from deforestation, agriculture and other sources.To have a good chance of limiting warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit compared to pre-industrial levels, carbon-dioxide levels would have to be kept below 450 parts per million (ppm) by 2100.(They are currently just above 400 ppm.)This would require emissions cuts of 40% to 70% by 2050, and near zero emissions by 2100.Accomplishing this without paying an exorbitant cost would require that actions begin within the next decade.Coal is reversing energy sector gains: While coal use is plummeting in the U.S., the increased use of coal in developing countries (much of it shipped from the U.S.) as a cheap source of electricity has reversed trends toward a progressively less carbon intensive energy sector.Business as usual is not climate as usual: Atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels are currently just above 400 parts per million (ppm), and are already the highest in at least the past 800,000 years.Under a business as usual scenario, the report says carbon can be expected to soar to higher than 1,300 ppm by 2100.This could lead to global warming ranging from 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit to 14 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, when the full range of scientific uncertainty is taken into account.We're on a CO2 binge: About half of all cumulative manmade carbon-dioxide emissions between 1750 and 2010 happened during the past 40 years.Since carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for as many as 1,000 years, the cumulative emissions are what determines how much warming we’re ultimately in store for -- and we’ve already burned about half of the carbon budget that would keep warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.If those in favor of acting to limit climate change feel vindicated by the report, that's not the same as feeling optimistic.Preventing dangerous climate change may be technically feasible, but the political will to take the hard and necessary decisions -- by the time we have to take them -- still seems to be lacking.In a clear sign of global warming's impact on the U.S., record-high temperatures are increasingly outnumbering record-low temperatures, a new data visualization shows.The visualization, which is based on data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), does not incorporate the most recent data from 2014 that shows cold records are outpacing warm records in the lower 48 states.However, this is likely a temporary speed bump in a longer-term warmup, especially as the summer approaches.The data is consistent with similar findings published in a peer-reviewed study in 2009, which found that this trend was unlikely due to natural climate variability alone.According to Brian Abelson, a data scientist at Enigma, the open data company that published the visualization, the new analysis takes advantage of the wider availability of public data sets in order to make the topic of climate change more relatable for people.The White House has even joined the open climate data bandwagon.It launched climate.data.gov in March in an effort to localize climate data and make climate science more relatable.\"One of the great difficulties about climate change, at least in the public discourse, is how removed your common person is from the knowledge and means of understanding of what’s coming out of the scientific community,” Abelson told Mashable.Enigma, which is headquartered in New York City, is a platform for public data that makes previously inaccessible information easily searchable.To create the visualization, including the animated map of record temperatures, Abelson and his colleagues examined data from the NCDC, including the Climate Extremes Index, which provides a measure of how unusual weather and climate conditions are.The visualization incorporates data from about 2,700 weather stations since 1964, Abelson said.(The data set was pared down from 90,000 weather stations to focus on the stations with the most reliable data.)“In one sense you get this map showing these weather events sweeping across the country,” he says.“As you see over time this pattern emerges, there are more and more hot anomalies.”Abelson says Enigma, which is a search and discovery platform for public data, is not trying to replicate or replace the work that climate scientists do.Rather, they are trying to fill a gap between highly technical scientific journal papers, and popular press accounts that don't include much locally relevant data.\"I certainly understand that there is a difference between us and climatologists, and we’re not trying to replace what they’re doing,\" Abelson says.Instead, the intent is to \"more easily communicate things in the public discourse that are more digestible than perhaps the manner in which academics are communicating these findings.”The evidence of an increase in the frequency and severity of hot temperature extremes is mounting, and it is not limited to the U.S. For example, a 2012 study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that between 1951 to 1980, extremely hot summers covered just 1% of Earth’s land area.This rose to 10% of Earth's land area by 1981 to 2010.The White House is planning to release a major new climate science report on Tuesday, which states unequivocally that global warming is already causing a wide range of harmful impacts across the United States.While the report is significant on its own, so too is the way the White House plans to roll it out.According to people with knowledge of the White House's plans, as well as Facebook and Twitter posts, eight television meteorologists are slated to have rare one-on-one interviews about global warming with President Barack Obama on Tuesday.This comes soon after the president sat down with a crew from Showtime's documentary series \"Years of Living Dangerously\" for an hour-long interview on climate change.That interview is scheduled to air sometime in the next few months.The list of eight participants in Tuesday's interviews includes Al Roker, co-anchor of NBC's Today Show; Ginger Zee, meteorologist on ABC's Good Morning America; John Morales, chief meteorologist of NBC 6 in Miami, Florida; and Jim Gandy, meteorologist of WLTX-TV in Columbia, South Carolina.A broader group of TV meteorologists and other key \"stakeholders\" who will play a part in communicating the findings of the National Assessment will be given access to senior White House officials in a larger event scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Washington.Tomorrow I'm going to the White House to interview President Obama about the National Climate Assessment report coming out— Al Roker (@alroker) May 5, 2014The White House's reliance on TV weathercasters to communicate news from climate science findings may be a new tactic for this administration, but it harkens back to the Clinton administration.Former president Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore tried that approach in 1997 when they invited dozens of TV meteorologists to an event in Washington, D.C.However, their efforts largely backfired when many participants viewed the event (and the subject matter) as too politicized, and thus grew more skeptical about the existence or severity of manmade global warming.Many TV meteorologists remain climate change skeptics, in part because they are skilled at forecasting weather over short time periods, which can make them doubt long-range projections from climate science computer models.Many TV meteorologists also lack specific training in climate science.(2/2) I will have a 1-on-1 interview with the President on Tue.Watch for my notes here and on @WLTX— Jim Gandy (@JimGandyWLTX) May 5, 2014On the other hand, TV meteorologists are typically the only scientists that most Americans encounter on a daily basis, and polls show they are broadly viewed as trustworthy messengers of science content.This makes them attractive conduits for conveying climate science findings, which the White House clearly recognizes.In recent years, as the science on climate change has solidified, more TV meteorologists have started airing climate information during their weather broadcasts.For example, WTLX's Gandy has worked with academics and a non-profit group to produce and broadcast climate segments in his market, and was recently given an award by the American Meteorological Society for doing so.It remains to be seen whether the Obama administration, which is just as politically polarizing as the Clinton administration (if not more so), will be warmly welcomed by the TV weather community.Tuesday's report is the third National Climate Assessment to be produced by an interagency committee with public input.The second such report was published in 2009, and this new version contains updated scientific findings and projections.The White House released the most comprehensive U.S.-focused climate science assessment ever conducted on Tuesday.It makes clear that global warming is no longer a phenomenon that will rear its ugly head in a far-off time and place.Instead, it is affecting everyone in the U.S. already, be it a farmer in Oklahoma dealing with heat waves and drought, or a coastal resident in New York City, still recovering from Hurricane Sandy's flooding.Here are some of the report's key findings, in graphics.Average U.S. temperatures have increased by between 1.3 and 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895.The country may be in for another 10 degrees Fahrenheit of warming by 2100, depending on the rate and magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions.Warming has affected every region of the country, especially since 1970.Warming ocean temperatures and melting ice sheets are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal cities such as Miami, Florida, and Boston, Massachusetts, with increased coastal flooding during high tides and storm surge events.The Northeast and Midwest are getting wetter and have seen a startling rise in extreme precipitation events.In other words, when it rains or snows, it really rains or snows.But the Southwest is getting drier, hotter and is seeing a sharp uptick in large wildfires.A tighter water supply will affect the lives and economies of nearly 60 million people in the Southwest, as population growth continues but water becomes more scarce.Today's oceans look almost nothing like what people were used to throughout human history, as carbon dioxide emissions make the ocean more acidic, warmer and with reduced seasonal sea ice.Climate change is already affecting agricultural production in the U.S., and may significantly curb the yields of some important crops.Many climate variables affect agriculture, from the number of dry days to the length of the frost-free season.Climate change already has an impact on Americans every day, and its effects will continue to grow as manmade emissions of greenhouse gases continue, according to a landmark report released Tuesday by the Obama administration.The report, officially known as the Third National Climate Assessment, is the most detailed examination yet of how climate change is altering everything from water availability in the drought-stricken Southwest to coastal flooding in the stormy Northeast.The White House is touting the report as part of President Obama’s “Climate Action Plan,” which was announced in June of last year.Next month, the administration is expected to unveil new and highly contentious regulations curbing emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important long-lived greenhouse gas, from existing power plants.The Obama administration is also working with local communities to improve preparedness for climate change impacts, such as sea level rise, and this report supports both policy tracks, according to John Podesta, senior advisor to the president.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Podesta said the National Assessment, which had been released in draft form in 2013 and subject to reviews from federal agencies and the public, offers “the most authoritative and comprehensive source of scientific information” about climate change impacts in the U.S.The report differs from other recent assessments of climate science, such as the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report, in that it drills down on specific impacts and projections for eight different regions in the country.“Climate change is not a distant threat, it is already affecting every region of the country and key sectors of the economy,” said White House science advisor John Holdren.“This national climate assessment is the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date.”The report is the third such examination of how climate change is affecting the U.S. specifically, and is the product of more than four years of work by hundreds of scientists.Since the second such assessment was published in 2009, climate science findings have become clearer and more dire, Holdren said.For example, Tom Karl, the director of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, told reporters that the last report predicted that sea levels would increase between 10 to 17 inches by 2100.The new report has greatly increased the upper end of that range, due to alarming findings about increased ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica.The new projection is for one to four feet of sea level rise during the current century, Karl said.The report highlights the risks that sea level rise poses to coastal cities such as Miami, Norfolk, Va., and Portsmouth, N.H.Considering that just two feet of sea level rise would more than triple the frequency of dangerous coastal flooding throughout most of the Northeast, if sea level rise were to hit the upper end of the new projections, it could prove extraordinarily expensive.Recent studies have shown that the rise in global average sea level since the late 1800s has been much greater than at any other time in the past 2,000 years, the report said.Since 1992, sea level has risen at twice the rate it had during the past century, decreasing the amount of time that residents of U.S. coastlines have to prepare for coastal flooding.The report paints a picture of a country in the grips of a large-scale transition, with shifts in extreme precipitation patterns, heat waves, coastal flooding and wildfire seasons all detected.These changes have occurred even though only a relatively modest increase in the average U.S. temperature has occurred so far, with an increase of between 1.3 to 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895.The most recent decade was the nation’s and the world’s hottest on record, and all regions of the country have experienced warming in recent decades.Temperatures are projected to rise by another 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit in most areas of the U.S. during the next few decades.Depending on the magnitude of global greenhouse gas emissions, average U.S. temperatures could skyrocket by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, assuming continued increases in emissions.The increase in average temperatures is reflected in an increasingly skewed balance between high and low temperature records.\"Many more high temperature records are being broken as compared to low temperature records over the past three to four decades – another indicator of a warming climate,\" the report says.More precisely, the number of record low monthly temperatures has declined to the lowest levels since 1911, while the number of record high temperatures in the U.S. has climbed to its highest level since the blistering 1930s, when the nation saw some of its worsts heat waves.In much of the U.S., especially the Midwest and Northeast, more rain is falling in short-duration, heavy bursts, leading to more flooding, the report says.The Northeast and Midwest may continue to get wetter, while the Southwest becomes even more parched, raising water supply and energy concerns there.The report warns the Southwest to prepare for major disruptions ahead due to climate change:\"Increased heat and changes to rain and snowpack will send ripple effects throughout the region’s critical agriculture sector, affecting the lives and economies of 56 million people –- a population that is expected to increase 68% by 2050, to 94 million.Severe and sustained drought will stress water sources, already over-utilized in many areas, forcing increasing competition among farmers, energy producers, urban dwellers, and plant and animal life for the region’s most precious resource.\"While the Southwest has a long history of naturally-driven droughts, some of which have lasted for decades, the droughts that occur now and in years ahead are likely to be hotter, thereby making them even drier than they otherwise would have been, the report says.The hot and dry conditions are also likely to lead to a significant increase in wildfire activity, which has already started to take place.According to studies cited in the report, projections include a doubling of burned area in the southern Rockies, with up to a 74% increase in burned area in California in coming decades.A new study that was recently accepted for publication in a scientific journal found that between 1984 to 2011, the number of wildfires over 1,000 acres in size from Nebraska to California increased by a rate of seven fires per year.The total area these fires burned increased by nearly 90,000 acres a year.The report also found that other types of extreme weather events have become more common in the U.S., which officials such as Karl linked to manmade global warming.Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, especially across the West and Southwest.In the future, the report shows the droughts and heat waves are projected to become more intense everywhere.Jerry Melillo, who led the federal advisory committee that spearheaded this report, told reporters that its findings are far more clear and confident than the past two such efforts.“We are all bearing the costs of increases in extreme heat, heavy downpours and increased coastal storm surges,” he said.“For decades we have collected the dots, now we have connected those dots.”Podesta said in addition to the press outreach activities taking place on Tuesday, which includes rare one-on-one interviews between President Obama and a select group of eight television meteorologists, the administration plans to “fan out” across the country to engage communities in a dialogue about its findings.This will involve various Cabinet members and leaders of scientific agencies, Podesta said.Following the release of a congressionally-mandated report showing that global warming is already having costly effects across the United States, the White House is taking action on Friday to boost renewable energy programs via the public and private sectors.The first announcement hits close to home for the Obamas, as the White House announced that the solar panels on the roof of the White House residence are now up and generating electricity.Under pressure from climate advocates, the White House agreed to install the panels back in 2010.This marks the first time the White House is generating some of its own energy since the Carter administration installed them in 1979 (President Reagan dismantled the panels in 1986).The panels will provide 6.3 kilowatts of solar generation, which is \"the typical size for the average American house,\" said James Doherty, a White House staff member, in a video on the White House website.This is not enough energy to power the entire White House complex, but security concerns prevented the installation of a larger system on the White House roof, Doherty said.In addition to the White House panels, President Obama is scheduled to announce more than 300 commitments to advance solar power deployment and energy efficiency measures across the country during a stop on Friday at a solar-powered Walmart store in Mountain View, California.The announcements keep with the administration's \"Climate Action Plan,\" which was outlined in June 2013.The measures also continue with the theme of executive action that bypasses a Congress that is deeply divided on the very existence of manmade global warming.The White House says the commitments, if achieved, will together cut carbon pollution by more than 380 million metric tons –- equivalent to taking 80 million cars off the road for one year -– and will save businesses nearly $26 billion on their energy bills.The new energy efficiency standards alone would help cut about 160 million metric tons of carbon pollution by 2030, the White House says.Solar energy deployment has increased dramatically in recent years.According to the Energy Information Administration, about a quarter of new power generation capacity in 2013 was from solar, which came in second, behind natural gas.One factor driving the surge in solar use is a rapid drop in the cost of solar panels.According to a White House fact sheet, the average price of solar panels has dropped by 60% since 2011.Since 2008, the White House said, the amount of solar power installed in the United States has increased nearly elevenfold -– from 1.2 gigawatts to an estimated 13 gigawatts today.The slew of clean energy and energy efficiency programs that President Obama is rolling out on Friday include two new energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment, including large electric motors that are used in factories to power assembly lines, and walk-in coolers and freezers.According to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, these standards could save more than $26 billion in electric bills by 2030.The private sector commitments include major new steps from commercial giants like Walmart, Ikea and Apple.For its part, Walmart is planning to double the number of onsite solar energy projects at U.S. stores, Sam’s Clubs, and distribution centers by 2020, which is part of the company's plan to drive the \"production or procurement\" of 7 billion kilowatt hours of renewable energy by the end of the decade.“We know from experience that investing in energy innovation allows us to save money, reduce carbon pollution, and create jobs,\" said Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., in a press release.Apple already powers 100% of its data centers using renewables, including rooftop solar panels, and is building a 2.8 million-square-foot headquarters that will also run entirely on renewables.As part of the White House initiative, Yahoo committed to adding a solar installation to their Sunnyvale headquarters by early 2015.John Oliver wants news networks to change the way they present climate change debates.Despite scientific reports about climate change impacting daily life, one in four Americans are still skeptical.On Sunday night's episode of Last Week Tonight, Oliver invited Bill Nye the Science Guy and a skeptic to put an end to the climate change debate.However, as a twist, Oliver also brings \"mathematical balance\" to the segment by inviting two supporters for the climate change denier and 96 other scientists in support for Nye.[seealso slug=charts-climate-change-alters-life/]Oliver makes a clear point about news media indulging faulty claims against climate change, while still being hilarious.He says in the segment, \"the debate on climate change should not be whether or not it exists, it's what we should do about it.\"BONUS: 16 Earth Porn Pics Hotter Than Global WarmingThe concept of climate change can be so overwhelming to the point where it paralyzes you into inaction.In light of a landmark report the U.S. government released on May 6, it's clearer than ever that climate change affects our daily lives, everywhere from decreased water availability to curbed agricultural production.But what can the average person actually do to fight climate change?[seealso slug=\"extreme-weather-photos\"]You've heard many times to recycle, use compact fluorescent light bulbs and take public transportation.These old standbys, while certainly helpful, can only do so much based on the scale of the problem.Instead, we've rounded up a few practical options you might not have considered in order to do your part.1.Stop upgrading your cellphone so often.Your mobile phone has a sizable carbon footprint.According to Ethical Consumer, the manufacturing of your phone alone causes 16 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and that figure rises to 22 kilograms when you add the power it consumers over the average use time of two years.Factor in the energy it takes to make calls over the lifetime of your phone, and you're left with a grand total of 94 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.To put this into context, the average passenger vehicle emits about 423 grams of carbon dioxide per mile.This means that simply manufacturing the average smartphone (not including use) is equivalent to driving a car nearly four miles.With one billion smartphones shipped in 2013 alone, that’s the equivalent of driving nearly 4 billion miles.And let's not forget what specifically goes into making our phones.Smartphones are made of precious raw materials that manufacturers extract and process, including copper, gold, lead, silver and palladium, as well as glass and plastic (made from crude oil).If you upgrade your phone every time a big tech company releases a new iteration, you're contributing to the extensive consumption of natural resources.So, hold onto your phone for as long as you can.When you do upgrade your phone, make sure you recycle it.For every 1 million smartphones recycled, we can recover 35,274 pounds of copper, 772 pounds of silver, 75 pounds of gold and 33 pounds of palladium.2.Shop online, rather than driving to brick-and-mortar stores.Home delivery services such as Amazon and FreshDirect have become so commonplace that we hardly think about their environmental impact anymore.On the whole, ecommerce cuts out the need for fuel and, therefore, involves fewer carbon dioxide emissions.However it's important to consider distances for shopping.According to one study, in-store shoppers gave off slightly fewer carbon dioxide emissions than online shoppers at distances shorter than 8.6 miles.For longer distances, online shoppers' footprints remained relatively stable, while brick-and-mortar shoppers' emissions skyrocketed, up to 451.4 grams of carbon dioxide per transaction (when traveling more than 62 miles).One UK study showed the average consumer would have to purchase 24 items at the market to make the trip equal to the carbon footprint of just one item ordered online.Bottom line: If you can walk or bike to a store, shop in-person.Otherwise, shop online.Businesses and marketers should take note, too.A recent study found that more than half of consumers are willing to pay at least 5% higher prices online if products were delivered sustainably.In addition, 76% of consumers would wait at least one extra day for shipping with \"climate-friendly transport.\"3.Consider the divestment movement.\"If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.\"This is the tagline of Fossil Free, a leader in the divestment movement, which calls for educational, religious and governmental institutions to divest from fossil fuels.College students have become increasingly influential in the divestment movement, pressuring their schools to freeze any new investments in fossil fuel companies, and divest from any other agreements within five years.Most recently, Stanford University announced it would divest its $18.7 billion endowment from coal companies due to the availability of alternative energy sources with lower greenhouse gas emissions.The student-led Fossil Free Stanford had a direct impact on the decision.To get involved, you can search Fossil Free's website for campaigns at your institution, or start one of your own.4.Eat locally (and less meat, if any).A widely cited statistic shows the average food item in the U.S. has traveled 1,500 miles from farm to table.Food author Michael Pollan told nonprofit Nourish California, \"If you’re in New York and you buy a bag of pre-washed, mixed lettuce that’s been grown in California’s Salinas Valley, it takes 56 calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to your plate.\"Eating locally reduces that significantly, and shopping at farmer's markets and nearby vendors will help your local economy.Meat also plays a huge role in climate change.The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says it's imperative for global warming not to pass 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Eating less meat is one of the most important ways to reach that goal.Statistics vary on how much raising livestock for meat affects climate change, but the numbers aren't good any way you swing it.In 2006, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization stated that 18% of greenhouse gases came from raising animals for food -- which is staggering.However, in 2011, the Worldwatch Institute maintained that livestock and their byproducts actually accounted for 51% of greenhouse gases.Twitter learned that Pat Sajak, the host of Wheel of Fortune, is a climate-change skeptic on Tuesday.Late Monday night, the 67-year-old game show host boldly tweeted that he believed \"global warming alarmists are unpatriotic racists.\"I now believe global warming alarmists are unpatriotic racists knowingly misleading for their own ends.Good night.— Pat Sajak (@patsajak) May 20, 2014(Last week he sent one similarity skeptical of global warming.)Twitter, the known hotbed of global warming alarmists, reacted as one might expect -- if a few hours delayed -- as its users tweeted jokes, insults and criticism back at Sajak, who has supported Republican causes in the past.Later on Monday, Sajak took his Twitter trolling for another spin, saying, \"Sometimes it's fun to poke a stick in a hornets' nest just to hear the buzzing.\"Below, see some of Mashable's favorite tweets from Tuesday's wheel of misfortune.[nggallery id=16595 layout=\"list\"]There's been a lot of chatter about climate change over the past few weeks -- and reasonably so.On May 6, the Obama administration released a report, officially dubbed the Third National Climate Assessment, which elaborately examined just how climate change is altering weather conditions in America.The consensus?We should be worried.The report, the third of its kind under the president's Climate Action Plan, breaks the states into eight regions and individually highlights each area's concerns.The northwest area of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, for example, is experiencing changing water streamflows and an increased number of wildfires, according to the report.Alaska has warmed twice as fast as the other regions in the past few years, resulting in rapidly melting glaciers and rising ocean temperatures.We reached out to a few climate reporters and experts, and asked what they do to lower their climate impact.Some of their advice is obvious -- recycle often, take shorter showers, maybe cool it with the over-the-top Christmas light yard shows.Other tips, like one writer's vow to never travel via air again, are a little more on the extreme side.Daniel Belknap, University of MaineDaniel Belknap, a researcher at the School of Earth and Climate Sciences at the University of Maine, has been studying climate and sea level changes for the past 40 years.While he was working as a geologist in 1982, Belknap started (1) using a wood stove and high-efficiency furnace in his home.\"I committed to being as energy efficient as possible, based on what I saw [at work],\" he says.His job requires quite a bit of travel -- most of which is off-road, usually while towing another vehicle -- but he says he's remained as conservative as possible with his personal yard work.\"All of our lawn and garden equipment is  (2) rechargeable and electric to cut back on local petroleum use,\" he adds.\"Global change is real, and we all need to seek more ways to lessen impacts.\"Kate Sheppard, Huffington PostKate Sheppard, an environmental reporter for the Huffington Post, has been writing about climate since 2006.As a resident of Washington, D.C., one of her main habits is  (3) biking as often as possible -- not exactly groundbreaking when it comes to being efficient, she admits, but given the growth of bike share programs (more than 500 cities across the world have them), it's at least becoming a much more practical option for most people.\"I also  (4) never leave anything plugged in,\" she says.\"That drives me crazy.Computers, air conditioners, fans -- if you're not using them, just unplug them.Otherwise it's a huge waste of energy.\"Eric Holthaus, SlateEric Holthaus -- \"America's weather-predicting boyfriend,\" according to The Awl -- is a meteorologist and weather writer for Slate.After the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report in September 2013, which highlighted, among other findings, that carbon emissions from humans were undoubtedly leading to dangerous climate alterations across the planet, Holthaus declared via a blog post that he would (5) never fly on an airplane again.\"It was the first report that really said 'the only way to keep our climate from becoming irreversible is for immediate action,'\" he tells Mashable.\"It just really hit me.I couldn't, and can't, think of not doing something like this.\"It's been tough.Holthaus had been, and still is, working on sustainability projects in eastern Africa, and has needed to work remotely or skip trips altogether because of his new pledge.Another habit he's adjusted since studying climate change is his diet.A few years ago, he (6) became a vegetarian because of the environmental impacts caused by most meat production industries.\"Until the U.S. adopts a carbon tax, like British Columbia, for example, it's up to people to perform voluntary actions like these,\" he says.\"It's hard to believe that humans can create changes on this large of a scale.But it's happening.\"Heidi Cullen, Climate CentralHeidi Cullen, chief climatologist at Climate Central, says it all comes down to (7) conversation -- being vigilantly vocal about raising awareness.\"Personal actions help, sure, but it takes more -- like state, international action -- to really make something happen,\" she says.\"I founded Climate Central in 2008 in part because I felt the conversation about climate change had fallen off the map.We, and more people, hopefully, can't let that conversation go away.\"Like others, Cullen has adjusted her diet -- she's \"almost\" a full-fledged vegan, as \"14% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the meat industry.\"She also uses (8) plastic sheets on her windows as a cheap

On[nggallery id=15155]President Obama will announce new EPA climate regulations on Monday -- and assuming they survive court challenges, they are expected to be the most significant global warming emissions cuts ever put in place by any U.S. president.The proposed regulations, which will set limits on emissions from coal-fired power plants and leave states and companies with the flexibility to determine how best to meet the standards, are scheduled less than a week after Obama spoke with unusual bluntness of the need for the U.S. to be \"out in front\" of international efforts to reach a new climate agreement, scheduled to take place in Paris next year.These steps, along with the president's climate action plan, signal the White House's intention to make climate change a top priority during the rest of the president's second term, and to reposition the U.S. to be a leader in international climate talks.In a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point Wednesday, Obama said the only way to have credibility abroad is to take significant steps on climate change at home.\"You see, American influence is always stronger when we lead by example.We can’t exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to everybody else.We can’t call on others to make commitments to combat climate change if a whole lot of our political leaders deny that it’s taking place.\"He described climate change as a military issue, given the potential for extreme weather and climate events to destabilize countries and involve the U.S. in humanitarian and other missions.Climate change, Obama said, is \"a creeping national security crisis that will help shape your time in uniform, as we are called on to respond to refugee flows and natural disasters and conflicts over water and food, which is why next year I intend to make sure America is out front in putting together a global framework to preserve our planet.\"While Obama has talked about climate change on numerous previous occasions, including a speech devoted to the subject in June 2013, he had not previously spoken so forcefully about leading the charge internationally.For example, when appearing at a State Dinner with French President Francois Hollande in February, Obama said of U.S.-French cooperation:\"Together, we will also rise to the challenge of climate change.Paris will be hosting the climate change conference in 2015.It is up to us to convince our major partners to take the necessary steps before it is too late.\"In an interview with Mashable, David Waskow, director of the international climate action initiative for the World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank, said the West Point speech did not represent a significant new policy, but that it \"did, however, take it to a new level in making explicit the administration’s intent to create a very strong global framework next year.”“The tone at West Point stood out, and the timing wasn’t coincidental,” Waskow said.Waskow says the speech dovetailed with the expected rollout of the EPA regulations, which the international community is watching closely to see how serious the U.S. is about meeting its emissions reduction goals, including the goal Obama agreed to in 2009 of reducing emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020.On Thursday, the New York Times reported that the emissions regulations, which will affect hundreds of existing coal-fired power plants, will call for up to 20% cuts in overall power plant emissions.Coal-fired power plants comprise 37% of all electric power generation capacity in the U.S., just behind natural gas.But they also account for the vast majority of the electricity-sector's greenhouse gas emissions.This makes the rules, which rely on the administration's executive authority, so important.(The White House has taken other actions to address emissions from other sectors, including transportation.)\"This is the rubber-hits-the-road moment, in a sense,\" Waskow said.He called the new rules \"a significant step by the administration -- and they’ll be seen that way, if the rules really move in a credible way to achieving the commitments the U.S. has already made internationally.”Caitlin Hayden, a White House spokeswoman, told Mashable the West Point speech did not indicate a change in administration policy, and the climate portion of the speech \"is not new news.\"Hayden pointed to the Hollande visit as an example of the President speaking publicly about leading in international talks.Also on Thursday, the White House Council on Economic Advisors released a report from the president's Council on Economic Advisors highlighting the country's progress in becoming energy independent while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The report claims that from 2005 to 2011, the U.S. reduced its \"total carbon pollution\" more than any other country, and now comprises about 15% of global carbon emissions.Much of this came by accident, via lower natural gas prices and a boom in domestic energy production.Although the jury is still out on how much natural gas production releases methane, a more potent short-term global warming gas compared to carbon dioxide, the report's focus on carbon reductions-to-date means these trends could bolster America's credibility and case for action in Paris next year.The climate policy push amounts to an end run around Congress, where a majority of Republican House members are skeptical of mainstream climate science findings.It follows the release of a series of major scientific reports.All of these reports, from the United Nations and the U.S. government, found that climate change is having more widespread and severe impacts than previously thought, and that time is running out to prevent far more severe consequences, from devastating amounts of sea level rise to disruption of food supplies.On Monday, the Obama administration announced the biggest step the U.S. has ever taken to curb emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming.The proposed rules, which would go into effect in one year, would reduce carbon emissions from power plants by 30% compared to 2005 levels by 2030.Obama has expressed hope that the rules would help the U.S. gain a leadership role on climate change leading up to an international climate summit in Paris next year.Now, just one day later, it appears the administration's actions may already be motivating China, which is the biggest player in global climate talks, to act at home as well, by instituting a national cap on carbon emissions.According to Reuters, He Jiankun, a university professor and deputy chairman of China's Advisory Committee on Climate Change, told a conference in Beijing on Tuesday that China will use a carbon cap when it forms and implements its next five-year plan that would guide government policies.It would also continue to use a metric known as carbon intensity, which measures the amount of emissions per unit of economic output.\"The government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan, by intensity and an absolute cap,\" Professor He said, according to Reuters.However, it's unclear how much authority He has, since he is an advisor to the government, rather than a high-ranking official.Still, any sign of movement toward a national carbon cap in China is a big deal.(Reuters later updated their story to make clear that professor He was speaking in his capacity as an adviser and academic, not from the government's point of view.)Ailun Yang, a senior associate who focuses on China at the World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank, told Mashable that Professor He is an influential advisor to the Chinese government on climate issues.\"Whatever he said shouldn't be said to be equivalent to government statements,\" Yang said.\"However his views are very important in the Chinese context.\"As Reuters also reported, China's emissions have skyrocketed by 50% since 2005.In contrast, U.S. emissions have dropped 10% since 2005, largely due to the economic downturn and a switch from coal to natural gas for generating electricity in many states.The possibility that China will cap its carbon, plus the U.S. announcement on Monday, could signal that the moribund international climate talks are in for a major revival.China and the U.S. are the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters.China's economic expansion, powered largely by coal, is leading to growing emissions and increasingly foul and hazardous air quality in many Chinese cities.For more than two decades of climate talks, China has resisted any absolute carbon emissions reductions, instead favoring measures that would be pegged to their economic development, Yang says.\"I think it's very positive to see that they are considering more formal and absolute targets,\" Yang said in an interview.\"... Just the fact that they're considering an absolute form of an emissions target, that itself is a very positive signal.\"However, the details of any climate plan matter a great deal, Yang said.According to Brad Plumer at Vox, He Jiankun also signaled that China's emissions would continue to rise through 2030, which is inconsistent with what scientists have said is necessary in order to limit global warming below dangerous levels.Those pesky details matter.Back in 2011, China introduced a cap on overall energy consumption.But that \"cap\" was more a set of guidelines than a binding limit.And, as a result, many of China's provinces continued to consume more energy than was allowed by the cap — in part because they have plenty of incentives to keep using coal and boost economic activity, Plumer wrote.China's actions are critical to addressing a common refrain from those who oppose U.S. action to reduce emissions.As the argument goes, such reductions will only be overwhelmed by emissions abroad from countries like China and India.But, if China enacts a meaningful carbon cap, that argument may have less potency in Washington.The Sangeang Api volcano in Indonesia began erupting on May 30, vaulting ash, along with tiny particles known as volcanic sulfur aerosols, as high as 65,000 feet into the stratosphere.Dramatic images from the eruption show the mountain exploding like a mushroom cloud.The ash grounded air traffic in northwest Australia and parts of Indonesia, since those aerosols are hazardous to modern high bypass turbofan engines and can cause them to shut down in mid-flight.Giant volcanic eruptions -- the most famous being the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, also in Indonesia -- are well-known for their ability to temporarily cool the Earth.But this eruption, even counted alongside a concurrent one in Alaska, are not large enough to make much of an impact on the planet's temperature trends on their own.The Sangeang Api volcano is located in the tropics, along the so-called Ring of Fire where the Earth's tectonic plates meet one another, leading to all sorts of geological hazards, from volcanoes to earthquakes.When volcanoes such as this one erupt, they can emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide, which acts to make the atmosphere more opaque, thereby shielding the planet from some of the sun's incoming radiation.This effect can theoretically offset some of the influence of manmade greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the atmosphere and warm the planet.Indonesia’s Mount Sangeang Api erupts.Credit: Sofyan Effendi #sangeang

influences on the climate, told Mashable that neither the Sangeang Api eruption nor a previous one at Mt.Semeru, also in Indonesia, put enough sulfur into the stratosphere \"to have any climate effect, even like the ones of the past decade.\"Robock estimates that Sangeang Api has lofted about 0.1 teragrams of sulfur dioxide into the air -- much of which did not make it into the upper reaches of the stratosphere, where it would have had the greatest possible influence.However, these volcanic events are the latest in a \"swarm\" of tropical eruptions since 2000 that have transported enough sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to reduce recent global warming.The Sangeang Api eruption is especially noteworthy because it is occurring in the tropics -- and recent scientific research has shown that tropical eruptions, even small ones, can have an outsized impact on the climate.A study published in the journal Nature Geoscience in February found that small tropical eruptions since 2000 has contributed to a slowdown in the rate at which global average surface temperatures increased in recent years.\"Tropical eruptions are usually more effective at cooling the climate compared to a high latitude eruption that is the same size, because it has the potential to impact both hemispheres and the aerosol topically stays in the atmosphere longer,\" says Ryan Neely, a researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder who has been examining the influence of sulfur dioxide emissions from volcanoes.In addition to volcanoes, factors such as increased air pollution in Asia and the uptake of an unusual amount of heat into the deep oceans have also been implicated in the temporary, short-term slowdown.A 2011 study published in the journal Science found that if stratospheric aerosols remain at elevated levels, the magnitude of future global warming may be somewhat masked -- but not mitigated.Yet another recent study, also published in Nature Geoscience in February, found that the 21st century increase in volcanic aerosol emissions could account for up to one-third of the temperature slowdown, also known as the \"warming hiatus.\"Whether this cooling influence will continue is an open question.But the eruption of tropical volcanoes such as Mt.Kelud in Indonesia in February, and now the eruption of Sangeang Api, suggest the swarm is not subsiding.\"We do not know, of course, how volcanic activity will evolve over the coming decade,\" says Benjamin Santer, a climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and coauthor of the study published in February on post-2000 eruptions.\"I find it quite fascinating that the swarm ... of early 21st century volcanic eruptions continues.\"Meeting just a few days after President Obama announced new regulations to cut global warming emissions from the electric power sector, the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized countries committed to working toward an “ambitious” new climate change agreement to be negotiated in Paris in 2015.In the leaders’ “Brussels G-7 Summit Declaration” released at the conclusion of the G-7 meeting that was dominated by ongoing tensions with Russia, they endorsed the goal of limiting manmade global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) or less above pre-industrial levels.Scientists have said this goal is technically possible, but only if drastic emissions cuts begin within the next few years, and net zero emissions are reached in coming decades.Currently, neither the U.S. nor the European Union (nor any other major emitter, for that matter) plan to make the kind of stringent cuts that would actually achieve this goal.The Obama administration’s proposed new EPA regulations, announced on June 2, seek to reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide -- the main long-lived greenhouse gas responsible for global warming -- by 30% compared to 2005 levels by 2030.They would mainly affect coal-fired power plants, which comprise 37% of all electric power generation capacity in the U.S., but account for the vast majority of the electricity sector's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Energy Information Administration.In a move related to the EPA regulations, President Obama has also said he wants the U.S. to regain a leadership role in international climate talks, and that this would be secured mainly by acting at home to improve the country’s credibility on the issue.The Brussels Declaration says the countries, including Canada, the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, express their “strong determination” to adopt a new climate treaty, or something similar under international law, in 2015.The statement describes the goal as working toward “a new protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force” under the U.N.Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was signed in 1992.The G-7 nations said this agreement should be “applicable to all parties” as well as “ambitious, inclusive and reflects changing global circumstances.” In other words, the G-7 will work toward an agreement that places the burden for cutting emissions on both industrialized and rapidly developing countries, such as China and India.In the past, China and India, along with other developing nations, have resisted calls for them to be subject to binding emissions cuts on the basis that they did not produce most of the pollution causing the current problem and have urgent needs to expand energy generation and use.China is now the world’s No.1 emitter of carbon dioxide and a hint emerged this week that the country may consider a national carbon cap for the first time.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route between Brussels and Paris, deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes said that the president’s new emissions plan was mentioned several times at the meeting.He said the plan gave “momentum” to the effort toward creating a new climate change agreement to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol, which was negotiated in 1997.This sense was echoed by Obama, speaking later at a press conference following a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron in Brussels, Belgium.The president called the proposed rules, which would be based on the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, “one of the most ambitious steps that any nation has taken to combat climate change.”The G-7 Brussels Declaration also mentioned a climate summit in September, to be hosted in New York by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.Until now, no world leaders had committed to attending the summit, which is being billed as a meeting for \"leaders at the highest level,\" according to the meeting's website.However, the statement strongly hints that at least some, if not all, G7 leaders will be there.“We welcome the Climate Summit of the United Nations Secretary General in September and his invitation to all Parties to prepare for ambitious contributions and to deliver concrete action to reduce emissions and strengthen resilience,” the document says.“We look forward to a successful Summit.”In an interview airing on Monday night, President Obama reveals his frustration with lawmakers who question the very existence of manmade global warming.The interview, conducted for the Showtime documentary series \"Years of Living Dangerously,\" features a revealing exchange between New York Times columnist Tom Friedman and Obama, in which the president admits to having the desire to \"unload on\" lawmakers, such as House Republicans, who question the existence of manmade global warming as well as its severity.Excerpts of the interview were published in the New York Times on Sunday, and a video clip was posted to Youtube.“Look, it’s frustrating when the science is in front of us,\" Obama said.\"...We can argue about how.But let’s not argue about what’s going on.The science is compelling....The baseline fact of climate change is not something we can afford to deny.And if you profess leadership in this country at this moment in our history, then you’ve got to recognize this is going to be one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that this country faces and that the planet faces.\"The good news is that the public may get out ahead of some of their politicians,” Obama said, citing the examples of Hurricane Sandy and the California drought as driving home the potential consequences of climate change.\"... People start thinking, ‘You know what?We’re going to reward politicians who talk to us honestly and seriously about this problem,’” Obama said.The interview was taped before the administration proposed its landmark EPA carbon rule that would reduce emissions from existing power plants by 30% relative to 2005 levels by 2030.(In late March, Mashable broke the news that Obama had given the interview.)In the interview, Obama says that in order to limit the severity of global warming, some oil and gas needs to be left in the ground.This view may come as a shock to the fossil fuel industry.Exxon Mobil Corp, for example, has told its shareholders that it does not foresee any policy scenario that would force the company not to exploit all of its oil and gas reserves.“We’re not going to be able to burn it all,\" Obama said.Over the course of the next several decades, we’re going to have to build a ramp from how we currently use energy to where we need to use energy.And we’re not going to suddenly turn off a switch and suddenly we’re no longer using fossil fuels, but we have to use this time wisely, so that you have a tapering off of fossil fuels replaced by clean energy sources that are not releasing carbon...\"According to Obama, one of his biggest concerns in climate policy and communication is avoiding cynicism, considering how much bad news has come out lately, such as the studies on the Antarctic ice sheet that concluded some of them are on course for an unstoppable, slow-motion melt.“The most important thing is to guard against cynicism,” Obama told Friedman.“I want to make sure that everybody who’s been watching this program or listening to this interview doesn’t start concluding that, well, we’re all doomed, there’s nothing we can do about it.There’s a lot we can do about it.It’s not going to happen as fast or as smoothly or as elegantly as we like, but, if we are persistent, we will make progress.”\"Years of Living Dangerously\" airs on Showtime Monday night at 8 p.m.ET\"No one ever said on her death bed, 'I wish I'd spent more time on Facebook,'\" says attorney and media correspondent Lisa Bloom.A more likely scenario: regret that she didn't do more to save her grandchildren from rising carbon dioxide levels, because she was too busy scrolling her News Feed and flipping through Us Weekly.Bloom believes Western society's current preoccupation with trivial celebrity gossip and insipid social media — and the time we waste with it — will be its downfall.As our fascination for easy entertainment increases, our investment in global affairs decreases.In particular, women should do more to fight climate change; it is a uniquely women's issue, she says.They are innately suited to battle climate problems, some would argue better than men.But it's not just climate that needs women's attention.We aren't spending enough time with global issues, in general.We're passing them up for \"dumbed-down\" media.Our culture needs to achieve balance between entertainment and education — before it's too late.[seealso slug=\"data-visualization-projects\"]It's a particular problem among women, says Bloom at the 92Y S.H.E.Summit last Friday.After all, 25% of young American women would rather win America's Next Top Model than the Nobel Peace Prize.Partly, celebrity worship is to blame, she says, and the shift away from local and international news.According to a 2012 Pew study, younger Americans aren't watching local news anymore; local TV viewership among adults under 30 dropped from 42% in 2006 to 28% in 2012.Despite a catastrophic decade for journalism in general, Hollywood and entertainment coverage is thriving more than ever.And alongside those stories about Rihanna's latest tattoo?Ads for lipstick, weight loss supplements and cosmetic surgery.It's not an accident.And women are eating it up by the fistful.Americans make up 5% of the world's population but American women account for 40% of cosmetic and plastic surgery purchases.\"We allow it and reward those media outlets by watching their shows, clicking on their sites and buying the ridiculous gossip magazines,\" Bloom tells Mashable.It wouldn't be as much of a problem if our interest in world issues increased along with our celebrity cravings.Unfortunately, it's the opposite.A 2013 UK report found women are more ignorant of politics and current affairs than men.Take climate change.As the science gets clearer, our interest has gotten less and less, says Bloom.We just don't care.\"Our media's fixation on whether Kim Kardashian is married this week to the exclusion of the destruction of our planet is shameful,\" she says.The responsibility to change starts with women, for a few reasons.First, the demographic inhaling said content is overwhelmingly female (women are more likely to watch reality programming than men, 49% vs. 24%, respectively), and second, women act as the primary caregivers for the generations to follow.They spend 50% more time providing care than male caregivers, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance.Women are the ones setting examples and caring for future leaders.\"I could make the somewhat sexist but surely true statement that women care more about our children and grandchildren, and we are leaving them an overheated, messed-up planet,\" says Bloom.Scientists are screaming to get our attention, a plea that is punctuated by extreme weather and rising ocean levels.According to the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment, temperatures in the U.S. are projected to increase by at least two to four degrees Fahrenheit in the next few decades, even hurtling 10 degrees higher by 2100, depending on the increase of greenhouse gas emissions.The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that climate change poses the greatest risk to the world's poorest populations, leading to food shortages and civil conflict.\"Is that the legacy we choose to leave to our descendants?\"Bloom asks.Bloom has an idea why this \"easy media\" movement has exploded in the first place.And the argument that \"women are dumb\" couldn't be further from the truth.\"Women are killing it in school.We're freakin' smart,\" she says.Girls are outperforming boys in school across all 50 states.If you look at the top 10% highest GPAs in U.S. graduating classes, it's \"crowded with girls.\"(The bottom 10%, she says, is crowded with boys.)And the education-gender gap is increasing.In 1994, 63% of female high school graduates enrolled in college, compared with 61% of males; by 2012, 71% of women enrolled in college immediately following high school, whereas men stayed at 61%.Nay, the problem isn't intelligence.James Curran, professor of communications at Goldsmiths, University of London, is the lead author of a 2013 study on women and public affairs.His theory is that public affairs are dominated by men, which discourages many women from getting involved or feeling included at the table.[seealso slug=\"twitter-politicians\"]But Bloom thinks the main problem is time, or a lack of it.She says most women she hears from genuinely want to get more involved, to change their media consumption habits, to read more books, to get involved in their communities, to stop mindlessly opening social media apps.But women in particular constantly feel the pressure to over-perform: to balance one or more jobs, care for the children, plan family activities and do housework.At the end of the day, they're spent.\"I'm just so tired,\" many women say.And then they flip on Real Housewives.\"It’s hard to find the time to focus on things that require discipline and mental effort … Celebrity gossip is easy.It’s titillating,\" Rita King, futurist and executive vice president for business collaboration organization Science House, tells Mashable.Problem-solving, on the other hand, is time-consuming, and you won't see immediate results.There's no quick \"adrenaline bump.\"It's a hunger for escapism from a life that seems increasingly demanding, says Bloom.The answer is to lift some of those demands women feel responsible for.\"Stop doing housework!\"she exclaims.Women are still doing one hour of housework more per day than men, when both still work full time.\"It's not the job of the family member with the vagina.\"Hire a housekeeper, she suggests, and if you can't afford one, split the work evenly among the whole family.Also, say no to things.Set boundaries and put yourself first.\"I'm very clear that my time is important … Like anything else that's fun and appealing, you have to jealously guard your time from its temptations.\"Bloom claims she's stopped wasting time online, and mainly uses Twitter to learn new things, start meaningful conversations, then step away.Bowe Burgdahl: seems like significant pieces still missing from this developing story.http://t.co/VWlg15nGQ7 Thoughts?— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) June 2, 2014Then spend that one hour you save each day reading real books: non-fiction, literature, essays.Bloom also suggests reading one national news site like The New York Times, plus your local news each day.\"Turn off all of these silly distractions that your culture is feeding you,\" says Bloom, and create new neuropathways in the brain.People who are readers become more connected with their communities and are more likely to take action and make improvements.In general, improved education for women leads to lower birth rates and a better economy, thereby addressing a couple of major contributors to climate change.It is one of the most important movements women need to be a part of, right now, Bloom writes in her book THINK: Straight Talk for Women to Stay Smart in a Dumbed-Down World.According to King, it's something women are actually hard-wired to excel at.Women have an innate talent at perceiving that which is not immediately in front of them.Because the female body is built to reproduce, women tend to think longer-term than men do, and care for and have faith in the unseen, whether it's a baby inside them they've never met or an invisible layer of greenhouse gases.Despite the male-dominated system we live in, says King, \"the leadership characteristics of the future absolutely will include many more things that have been traditionally considered feminine.\"Ultimately, it's a woman's choice whether to define her femininity with cosmetics and reality television.But maybe we broaden the definition a little to include a more ambitious definition of self-improvement, which has lasting and sometimes global impact.Giving the commencement address at the University of California at Irvine on Saturday, President Obama openly mocked the climate science and policy positions of many Republican lawmakers, without naming any names.This was the first time that Obama had launched such a frontal assault on those who are trying to stymie his efforts to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that are causing global warming, such as carbon dioxide.On June 2, the Obama administration introduced draft regulations to reign in emissions from existing power plants in the U.S. by 30% below 2005 levels by the year 2020.Many Republicans denounced these proposed rules as a \"War on Coal,\" and argued against them on scientific grounds as well.In a June 9 interview that aired on Showtime, Obama said he was tempted to call out congressional skeptics of climate science for being out of touch with the scientific community, and for ducking their responsibility to help solve a difficult but crucial problem.Apparently, that temptation proved to be a strong one.At UC Irvine, Obama told the graduates that what he is up against on domestic climate policy is unique, because his opponents in Congress deny the very existence of the problem itself.\"The climate change deniers suggest there’s still a debate over the science,\" he said.\"There is not.\"The president continued:It’s pretty rare that you’ll encounter somebody who says the problem you’re trying to solve simply doesn’t exist.When President Kennedy set us on a course for the moon, there were a number of people who made a serious case that it wouldn’t be worth it; it was going to be too expensive, it was going to be too hard, it would take too long.But nobody ignored the science.I don’t remember anybody saying that the moon wasn’t there or that it was made of cheese.Today’s Congress, though, is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence about climate change.They will tell you it is a hoax, or a fad.One member of Congress actually says the world is cooling.There was one member of Congress who mentioned a theory involving “dinosaur flatulence” -- which I won’t get into.Obama attacked lawmakers who openly deny the findings of mainstream climate science, as well as those who have recently sought to duck climate questions by saying that they're not scientists, and therefore not qualified to make a judgement.Prominent politicians who have employed this tactic recently include House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida).\"There are some who also duck the question,\" Obama said.\"They say -- when they’re asked about climate change, they say, “Hey, look, I’m not a scientist.” And I’ll translate that for you.What that really means is, 'I know that manmade climate change really is happening, but if I admit it, I’ll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot, so I’m not going to admit it.'”\"Now, I’m not a scientist either, but we’ve got some really good ones at NASA.I do know that the overwhelming majority of scientists who work on climate change, including some who once disputed the data, have put that debate to rest,\" Obama said.Remarks by the President at University of California-Irvine Commencement CeremonyObama didn't aim his criticism solely at Congress.He also said the media has not spent enough time covering global warming, noting that when major newscasts broadcast segments on the topic they often have political talking heads involved, rather than scientists.\"When we introduced those new anti-pollution standards a couple weeks ago, the instant reaction from the Washington’s political press wasn’t about what it would mean for our planet; it was what would it mean for an election six months from now,\" Obama said.The speech wasn't entirely a downer.Obama announced the creation of a $1 billion climate change resiliency initiative to provide grants to cities and states in order to harden infrastructure against the threat of more extreme storms and floods, among other climate change-related consequences.A new poll released on Monday shows widespread public support for Barack Obama’s controversial carbon emissions reduction regulations proposed on June 2.The poll, conducted by Hart Research Associates and Public Opinion Strategies for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, found that 57% of Americans approve of a proposal that would require companies to cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, even if that proposal would increase their utility bills.The poll also found that a majority of the public -- 61% -- believe that there is at least enough evidence showing that global climate change is a serious enough problem to warrant taking action (this is up from 54% in 2009).The poll included 1,000 American adults and has a margin of error of 3.1%.On June 2, the Obama administration issued draft regulations that would mandate cuts to carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants by 30% below 2005 levels by 2020.The proposed rules, which would be implemented using the administration's authorities under the Clean Air Act, would give states flexibility in how they would achieve these reductions at the lowest possible cost, from joining carbon trading systems with other states to investing in renewable energy sources.The poll found that a majority of Americans support the proposal, despite the Republican Party’s denunciation of the plan as part of a “war on coal” that would have devastating economic consequences.In addition, the poll found that 67% of respondents somewhat to strongly support the EPA policy, compared to 29% who somewhat to strongly oppose it.Support for EPA Carbon Regulations | Create InfographicsThe poll comes on a day when four former Republican administrators of the EPA testified in favor of the regulations before the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety.Speaking to reporters before the hearing, the former officials lamented the polarization that has taken place between the parties on climate change, and said that Republicans will only start supporting taking action on climate change once the public demands it.“When all of these enviro issues have been dealt with successfully in the past it’s when there’s strong public support for action,” said William Ruckleshaus, who served as the first-ever EPA administrator when Richard Nixon established the agency in 1970.“If there’s demand for action, there will be action.”William K. Reilly, who served as EPA administrator under President George H.W.Bush, said President Obama’s recent criticism of Republican lawmakers as “climate deniers” probably won’t help or hurt public support for the regulations, because the public is already on board with the need to take action.“I don’t think the politics of it was uppermost in his mind,” Reilly said, referring to a fiery speech Obama delivered at the University of California at Irvine on June 14.“I think he is pleasantly surprised that the country has come to support” his actions, Reilly said.Christine Todd Whitman, George W. Bush’s first EPA chief, said she knows of several Republicans who do believe the climate is changing in part due to human activities, but they need “political cover” in order to support policy proposals.While the former officials said they hoped to encourage some bipartisan cooperation on the climate issue, it became immediately just minutes into the hearing that this is not going to happen anytime soon.Once the hearing began, which was on the “need to act” to address climate change, Republican senators pounced on the Obama administration’s actions as a “federal takeover of the electricity system” and a “disaster” for the country that would have “no environmental benefits.” Democrats, meanwhile, hailed the proposal as a commonsense step toward addressing a major environmental problem.The former EPA officials took in the spectacle from the witness table, like relics from a distant past in which lawmakers reached across party lines on issues like clean air and water.The science behind what makes our planet's temperature rise is pretty straightforward.Pollutants like soot and greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide trap heat within the earth's atmosphere, the global average surface temperature goes up, ice caps melt, sea levels rise and extreme weather events become even more extreme.However, American college students are coming with with some of the coolest ways to battle climate change and clean up domestic energy production.From earning rewards while tracking your energy consumption to recharging your battery with a run, here are six projects giving a greener future the old college try.1.REECycleRecycling rare earth elements to save energy and make moneyEnding the United States' dependence on fossil fuels is easier said than done.But REECycle, a process developed by students at the University of Houston, might make fueling the clean, green break from oil, coal and natural gas easier.Efficient electric motors and wind turbines depend on neomagnets made from neodymium and dysprosium, two rare earth elements (REE) that are difficult to find and harmful to mine.However, REECycle has developed a way of reclaiming these elements from trashed electronics, and then reselling them for profit.The process goes like this: REECycle removes the copper plating from the products, dissolves the neodymium and dysprosium in a solvent, ditches the leftover metals and then filters the REEs out to sell them to manufacturers.This, in turn, limits the need for freshly mined REEs, makes it easier and cheaper to produce efficient energy generators, and creates a financial incentive to do something good for the environment -- something oil companies rarely have unless a major spill happens.To top it all off, less fossil fuel usage can lead to less dependence on foreign oil and more investment in domestic sources of clean energy.2.KAir BatteryAn energy efficient potassium-oxygen batteryIf you think fruit-powered batteries are cool, this invention out of Ohio State University might be the cream of the crop.The KAir battery uses the potassium commonly found in bananas as one-half of a 98% energy efficient battery.Potassium -- \"K\" on the periodic table -- makes up the negatively-charged anode side of the battery.The positively-charged diode is porous, oxygen-rich carbon, which pulls in more oxygen from the air as the battery is used to make potassium oxide (KO2).When the battery gets charged, the KO2 breaks down to its original components, restoring what was lost during usage.This process makes the battery more energy efficient, and its non-toxic materials make it cheaper and easier to produce than other batteries.3.Meter GeniusTracking home energy consumption and earning discountsYour electric company will tell you how much energy you're using, but with MeterGenius, you can track your consumption in real time, and get tips on how to save energy and money based on your specific energy usage.The platform was developed by a team of students at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, along with graduate and doctoral students at the university's engineering school.MeterGenius also gives the user several incentives to save energy beyond saving money -- it lets you compare how much energy and water you're using to how much your neighbors are (if they also use the platform), adding a little friendly competition to environmental conservation.If contests aren't your thing, you can still earn reward points that can be redeemed for bill discounts.The one caveat is that the platform will only be offered to those who get their electricity from retail suppliers in deregulated districts, which restricts MeterGenius to 16 states.[seealso slug=\"innovations-world-2013\"]4.California Wave Power TechnologiesUsing a carpet on the ocean floor to harness wave energyAnyone who's ever been thrashed by a wave at the beach can tell you how powerful the ocean can be.A team of professors at the University of California, Berkeley have created a flexible seabed carpet that harnesses the ocean's power to create hydraulic pressure.The carpet sits on double-acting pumps, and as the carpet moves with the rhythm of the ocean, the pumps are compressed, sending hydraulic pressure through a series of pipes to an offshore power plant.This pressure can used to run generators or turbines, or even used for clean water.The energy is incredibly dense, too: Just 10 meters of ocean floor covered by the carpet can produce the same amount of energy as a soccer field covered in solar panels, according to the team's calculations.The carpet is currently being tested in a wave tank at Berkeley, but an ocean test is scheduled for 2016.5.Energy InternetDistributing energy through a decentralized networkSome projects try to change how we use energy, but Energy Internet would revolutionize how we get it.This project from the Georgia Institute of Technology wants to model energy distribution after the Internet, creating a decentralized network of networks, instead of a hierarchical system of transportation.This would allow energy consumers and producers to send and receive just enough energy to satisfy needs, and make it easier for sources of renewable energy to integrate into the grid at large.It would also require less energy to be produced -- which would help limit harmful emissions -- and shift more of that load onto the shoulders of clean energy producers.6. myPowerExercising to charge your phoneWalking or biking to a destination instead of driving is one way to limit your personal carbon emissions, but now, a workout can also help you save energy and charge your phone battery.Students at Northwestern University developed a device that uses the kinetic energy you expend while exercising to charge your phone.The inventors claim 10,000 steps and either a 45-minute run or 60-minute bike ride will give your phone an extra six hours of battery life, while ditching the extra cardio and sticking to the walking will give it three.While the running you do to power your device is longer than sprinting across the room to grab your charger, you'll be saving stress and electricity one step at a time.When it comes to climate change, there are many misconceptions, distortions, outright lies and memes circulating online.In fact, entire websites argue the mainstream scientific conclusion that manmade emissions of greenhouse gases are causing harmful global warming.Don't forget the sites designed to counter those sites, and on and on.In an effort to clear up some of the climate confusion, here are the top six climate myths, debunked.[seealso slug=\"google-earth-amazing-discoveries\"]1.Myth: The earth can't be getting hotter, because it's cold out.Truth: There's a difference between short-term weather variability and long-term climate change.Weather is the day-to-day variations in precipitation, temperature and clouds.Climate, on the other hand, is the average weather pattern in a place over many years.When examining climate change, scientists typically look at 30-year timeframes or longer, whereas weather involves a 5-10-day forecasts.An old adage says, \"Climate is what you expect.Weather is what you get.\"Or, as Stephen Colbert once said, \"Isn't climate just made up of thousands of little weathers?\"The National Climate Assessment states:While there is a clear long-term global warming trend, some years do not show a temperature increase relative to the previous year, and some years show greater changes than others.These year-to-year fluctuations in temperature are due to natural processes, such as the effects of El Niños, La Niñas, and volcanic eruptions.So, even as the climate warms, there will still be cold days and snowstorms.In fact, some scientists think that by melting Arctic sea ice, global warming may be causing bigger swings in the jet stream that can encourage frigid air to move south into the winter, into parts of the U.S. and Europe.2.Myth: The climate has changed before, so this change must be normal, too.Yes, the climate has changed, sometimes extremely rapidly, in the past.Truth: Natural factors turned the climate dial in the past, but now, humans are causing the bulk of the change.One of the biggest control knobs of the climate system (both in history and now) is carbon dioxide, or CO2.Truth: Right now, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is the highest it's been in all of human history.3.Myth: The Sun is responsible for global warming.Solar activity can cause climate swings.Truth: Scientists have conducted studies of the sun's interaction with the climate and concluded that none of its recent behavior accounts for today's shift.The majority of the warming at the global scale over the past 50 years can only be explained by the effects of human influences, especially the emissions from burning fossil fuels and from deforestation, while natural factors have played a more minor role.4.Myth: Climate change is actually good for us.[img src=\"http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6_25_14_andrew_nasabluemarble.jpg\" caption=\"Nasa \"Blue Marble\" image taken in January 2012 of the Earth aken from the VIIRS instrument aboard NASA's Suomi NPP satellite. \"credit=\"NASA\" alt=\"NASA Blue Marble\"]Climate change may mean longer growing seasons and newly accessible territory for some countries, such as Russia and Canada.Truth: Overall, the negatives, such as flooding and drought, outweigh the positives.This is especially true if emissions aren't reduced and temperatures increase at a rapid pace.For example, a recent report found that climate change could cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars within the next few decades.5.Myth: CO2 can't be dangerous, because plants need it.Plants do need CO2 to grow.But research has shown that with too much CO2 in the air, plants may actually suffer and crops may become less nutritious.Truth: Extreme heat and precipitation extremes can hurt crop yields.6.Myth: Scientists don't agree about climate change.Truth: Climate scientists are in near 100% agreement that human activities are contributing to global warming.The main areas of uncertainty concern how significant the warming will be, and how different places will be affected.Third time's a charm for NASA.The space agency successfully launched a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket carrying its Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite to space early Wednesday morning from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.The satellite will track greenhouse gases in an effort to uncover clues about climate change.The successful liftoff comes after two failed attempts: one on Tuesday due to a technical error.The one in 2009, however, was catastrophic, and NASA lost a similar satellite that was also set to study carbon dioxide.It took a nosedive into the ocean near Antarctica after a hardware failure with the rocket.But now the space agency is back on track with this latest satellite.OCO-2 is one of NASA's most important climate satellites because it could greatly advance our understanding of the carbon cycle at a time when the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, caused primarily by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, is at an all-time high.Scientists know much about the carbon cycle, but key questions remain unanswered regarding the size of some of the major carbon sources and sinks.Humans release nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually, with about half of that getting absorbed by the land and oceans, and half remaining in the atmosphere for centuries.According to NASA, the satellite will track carbon by looking at the wavelengths of sunlight that carbon dioxide absorbs.Additional reporting by Andrew FreedmanWhile some of the planet's richest nations are focused on the issue of climate change and how to lessen humanity's impact on the environment, officials in Dubai have plans that may ultimately eliminate the concern altogether by building a climate-controlled city.Called the Mall the of the World, the 48 million square-foot mini-metropolis would be the first city-sized enclosure to allow residents to completely avoid outside conditions for extended periods of time.[seealso slug=\"architecture-city-life\"]Using 4.5 miles of enclosed promenades, the vision of Dubai Holding, the developer of the project, is to allow visitors the ability to experience normal city life inside the controlled environment for weeks on end.Although the idea of such a massive enclosure might seem off-putting some, because of Dubai's extreme summer temperatures, which average 104 degrees, the temperature-controlled environment could become the region's most popular destination.During Dubai's winter months, when temperatures average 73 degrees, the city's enclosed promenades will be opened to allow in the fresh air.Included in the city will be 100 hotels and luxury apartments, a \"wellness district\" designed to attract medical tourists (an increasingly important aspect of Dubai's business development) and what the project's developers expect to be the largest theme park in the world.\"Tourism is key driver of our economy and we aim to make the UAE [the United Arab Emirates] an attractive destination all year long,\" said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, in a statement on Saturday.\"This is why we will start working on providing pleasant temperature-controlled environments during the summer months.\"Accompanying the announcement of the project, the developer also unveiled a slick teaser video (see above) showing off the design of the climate-controlled city, a futuristic set of images that bear a striking similarity to the kind of science fictional enclosed cities depicted in films like Logan's Run.While the immediate intention of the Mall of the World may be to offer luxury in the middle of the desert, in the light of increasing pollution concerns in major cities like Beijing, the atmosphere-proof development may end up showing the entire world the way how such enclosed cities might work practically if we ever need them.The company hasn't revealed how much the project will cost, nor when it will be completed, but given Dubai's history of successfully completing similarly ambitious development undertakings, there's little doubt about the viability of the project.On July 2, the National Park Service released a report by two of its scientists that confirms that 289 of America’s parks and historic sites are experiencing climate change.That is, many are getting and staying hotter for longer, enduring more severe spikes in temperature, experiencing biblical deluges, or losing beach to erosion and rising tides.No great surprise, really, and the report is not alarmist but matter of fact: If future generations are to spend the Fourth of July visiting Jamestown, Va., say, or Harpers Ferry, W.Va., or floating on Lake Mead on the Nevada-Arizona border, steps will need to be taken -- and soon -- to better protect them.“Studies like this are critical to inform national park managers and visitors alike about their local climate impacts so they can take proactive steps to address climate change,” says the nation’s top ranger, Jonathan Jarvis.The NPS director says the parks can be seen as an early-warning system and laboratory, too, because the parks are “places where we can monitor and document ecosystem change without many of the stressors that are found on other public lands.”A few week ago, Jarvis’s boss, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell (the subject of a profile in last week’s Bloomberg Businessweek), convened a roundtable on climate impacts at Jamestown, the first permanent English colony in North America.She noted that Jamestown Island had already lost 98 feet of coastline, along with the remains of a Civil War fort and Native American artifacts estimated to be 10,000 years old.The climate science, she says, is clear, but even if you want to debate its causes, “all you have to do is open your eyes and look around you to see that it’s real.We have to deal with it.”SEE ALSO: Sally Jewell: Obama's Pro-Fracking Climate CzarThe former chief executive officer for Recreational Equipment Inc., Jewell points out that America’s parks aren’t just scenic landscapes and historical points of interest, but also economic drivers that contribute tens of millions of dollars to the U.S. economy annually -- much of it to nearby communities.In 2012 (the most recent year for which figures are

cork, they can kiss that meticulously cultivated flavor goodbye.Many people may only worry about corks when it's time to pop the Champagne, but some experts are worried about wine cork quality, which has been mysteriously in decline for almost 20 years.Corks are made from the bark of Quercus suber trees, commonly called cork oaks, which grow only in southwest Europe and northwest Africa.More and more low-quality cork trees with thin bark are sprouting up.Now scientists think rising temperatures and increased exposure to ultraviolet, or UV, light brought on by climate change may be behind chemical changes in the bark of cork oaks.\"There are several factors like climate change, landscape changes and the dry seasons getting longer that could be causing the decline,\" Rita Teixeira from the University of Lisbon, told Live Science.\"The change in bark quality may be the trees' way of adapting.\"Bark acts as the protective outer layer on trees that protects the plant from drought and shields against radiation.Cork oaks have been growing thinner and more porous layers of bark.Cork producers need bark that's at least 27 millimeters (1 inch) thick to make a good cork, but most of the trees are now producing bark between 3 mm and 10 mm (0.1 inches and 0.4 inches), Teixeira and colleagues write in their study, which was published June 22 in the Journal of Experimental Botany.To figure out what might be causing the changes, Teixeira and a team of researchers analyzed genes in the bark of five high-quality cork trees and five low-quality cork trees growing in Portugal.The scientists discovered that heat shock proteins are essential to the bark of high-quality cork trees.These proteins help the tree grow normally even under stressful conditions like drought and high temperatures, and promote cell division that makes the bark grow thicker.Bad cork trees have fewer of these shock proteins, but they have more genes that produce huge amounts of phenolic compounds, UV-absorbing chemicals that collect inside the bark.Teixeira and colleagues found that poor-quality cork trees have twice as many phenolic compounds as good-quality cork trees, which suggests the bad-quality cork trees are adapting to protect themselves from elevated radiation levels.The researchers also discovered that the trees with thin layers of bark have lots of lenticular channels — small airways that allow gas exchange between the bark and the outside air.Corks made from this kind of bark are considered low quality, because the lenticular channels allow more air to enter the bottle.The oxygen seeping in reacts with the alcohol and makes acetic acid that gives the wine an unpleasant sour and vinegar-like taste.A batch of bad corks can ruin entire cases of wine, Teixeira said.The global cork industry is worth about $2 billion, but metal wine stoppers are cheap alternatives and are growing in popularity.Past research published in Flavour and Fragrance Journal found that consumers could not tell the difference between wine corked with a natural oak-based cork and wine that was corked with a metal stopper.However, many wine producers still prefer the original oak-based cork, but the choice between a cork and a metal cap is hotly debated among wine enthusiasts.President Obama will attend the high-level climate change \"summit\" that the United Nations plans to hold in New York on September 23, the White House said on Friday.The summit falls during the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting as well as the yearly Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York, which both attract world leaders.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will lead the summit, which aims to build momentum toward a new global climate treaty when negotiators meet a year later in Paris.The U.N. has also invited other leaders, including mayors of cities worldwide and business interests, to attend the meeting and make new commitments to addressing global warming.Obama's announcement may put pressure on other world leaders to participate, especially Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country is the top greenhouse gas emitter in the world, as well as the leaders of India and Brazil, two other key developing nations whose emissions are increasing.Obama has sought to make tackling climate change part of his legacy bysetting a goal to cut U.S. emissions 17% by 2020, compared to 2005 levels, among other actions.In June the White House announced new draft EPA rules that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to 30% below 2005 levels by 2020.The proposed rules, dubbed the \"Clean Power Plan,\" are based on the White House's executive powers under the Clean Air Act.They are the biggest step ever taken by any U.S. president to reduce the U.S. contribution to global warming, which is largely due to manmade emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.NASA plans to launch a small satellite that, if successful, could help climate scientists improve computer models depicting future manmade global warming.The satellite, dubbed \"IceCube,\" is the first of six new CubeSat missions that were selected as part of a new initiative during this fiscal year, and the only one to focus on our home planet.No word yet on whether the rapper of the same name feels like NASA is cramping his style.CubeSats are a particular class of spacecraft known as nanosatellites, thanks to their small size.The typical CubeSat is about four inches long and weighs about 3 pounds; these small satellites hitch a ride on previously planned space missions, rather than requiring their own launch vehicle to get them into space.For NASA, CubeSats present an opportunity to test sophisticated instruments in a space environment, with the intention of using those instruments on subsequent, more expensive satellite missions.“We're maturing technology to make it more ready for spaceflight in the future,\" Jeff Piepmeier, associate head of Goddard’s Microwave Instruments and Technology Branch, told Mashable.With IceCube, which is also known as EarthSat-1, scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, will use the satellite to test a 874-gigahertz submillimeter-wave receiver designed to improve scientists' understanding of high-altitude ice clouds.Such clouds are comprised of ice crystals and supercooled water droplets that freeze upon contact with a surface.Clouds comprised of such crystals and droplets include cirrus clouds, which often appear as high, thin and wispy clouds on a fair weather day.Depending on composition, thickness and location, clouds can either reflect more incoming solar radiation than they absorb, thereby offsetting some of global warming, or they can trap more outgoing infrared radiation from the Earth's surface, which enhances warming.Getting a better handle on these dynamics, especially on the role played by high altitude clouds, would help make climate change projections more accurate, scientists say.The satellite will be about a foot long and just four inches wide, NASA said, and it will fly as part of a group of CubeSats, with the others focused on measuring various aspects of the Sun.According to NASA, the instrument that IceCube will test is designed to shed light on a current gap in observations that exists in the middle to upper troposphere, at heights of about 20,000 to 35,000 feet, where ice clouds can be \"too opaque\" for infrared and visible sensors to penetrate.Microwave wavelengths, on the other hand, are not sensitive to ice, a NASA press release stated.“We plan to leverage as much commercially developed technology as possible,\" Piepmeier said.\"This particular receiver that we’re maturing has a science application that NASA scientists are interested in and we’re trying to fulfill that mission.”Ultimately, the team wants to use this receiver for an ice-cloud imaging radiometer for NASA’s proposed Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE) mission, which would shed insight on how much solar and infrared radiation ice clouds are absorbing and reflecting.No other mission currently measures the real time effects of these clouds on the Earth's radiation budget, Piepmeier said.The IceCube satellite is expected to be ready for launch within the next two years, and once in orbit it will remain there for only a few months, which is far shorter than the typical lifetime of a large satellite, which tend to be in orbit for at least five-to-10 years.However, this one will cost just 1% of the typical price tag of a \"full-fledged science mission,\" Piepmeier added.According to Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, who is not involved in the IceCube project, the composition of clouds is a key factor that needs to be better understood in computer model simulations of the planet's atmosphere.\"There certainly are issues related to ice in clouds: Many clouds are supercooled, below the freezing point, and are dependent on the right kind of nucleus to form an ice particle,\" he wrote in an email to Mashable.\"For climate it makes a difference in terms of the brightness of clouds and thus how much radiation they reflect.It may also affect the precipitation potential (how much hangs around vs. falls out).\"Trenberth said improving computer models' simulation of clouds is likely to be the main payoff of NASA's cloud-focused satellite project.Private sector CubeSat companiesNASA's push into CubeSat development, which is being pursued in concert with the private sector and universities, comes at the same time as the private sector small satellite industry is going through a growth spurt.Companies like PlanetLabs and SkyBox have already demonstrated their ability to successfully launch satellites into orbit at a fraction of the cost of conventional large spacecraft.These companies are looking to use small satellites to accomplish a range of profit-yielding tasks, from helping Wall Street analysts gauge Wal-Mart sales trends by counting the number of cars in store parking lots nationwide, to monitoring the destruction of rainforests.Above, Skybox Imaging HD video of conflict in Tripoli.SkyBox Imaging, for example, is already using its satellites to provide HD video of the Earth, including capturing a video of the intense fighting in Tripoli, Libya this week.In a sign of the popularity and potential applications of CubeSat technology, Google acquired five-year-old SkyBox in June for $500 million in cash.Ants may be some of Earth's most powerful biological climate brokers, a provocative new study claims.The average ant lives and dies in less than a year, but a long-term experiment tracking the insects' effects on soil suggests they cooled Earth's climate as their numbers grew.\"Ants are changing the environment,\" said lead study author Ronald Dorn, a geologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.Dorn has discovered that certain ant species \"weather\" minerals in order to secrete calcium carbonate -- better known as limestone.When ants make limestone, the process traps and removes a tiny bit of carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere.SEE ALSO: Close-Up Photos of Amazing Ants of the WorldThis ant limestone factory is a small-scale version of the massive planetary-cooling process that takes place in the oceans, known as carbon sequestration.Limestones deposited in the ocean hold more carbon than is present in the atmosphere today.Dorn discovered that ants were powerful weathering agents by tracking the breakdown of basalt sand.At the start of his career, 25 years ago, Dorn buried sand at six sites in the Catalina Mountains in Arizona and Palo Duro Canyon in Texas.Every five years, Dorn has dug up a bit of sand from the sites and measured how much the minerals olivine and plagioclase have degraded from exposure to water, insect activity and chemicals from tree roots.Dorn's experiment revealed that ants appear to break down the minerals 50 to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed on bare ground.At the same time, the ants were gradually building up limestone within their nests.Dorn thinks the ants may be scavenging calcium and magnesium from the minerals and using these elements to make limestone.In the process, the insects may trap carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the rock.The transformation could take place when ants lick sand grains and stick them on the walls of their nests, but Dorn said the process is truly a scientific mystery.\"We don't know if they are licking it or pooping it, or if it's bacteria in the ant's gut or the fungi growing in the colonies,\" Dorn told Live Science.The findings don't reveal how much atmospheric carbon might be missing thanks to ants, either.\"We're very, very early in the game,\" Dorn said.While he's only speculating at this point, Dorn said he thinks the sheer biological mass of ants working in concert could have removed significant quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere since the insects expanded their numbers starting 65 million years ago.Eight ant species are known to secrete calcium carbonate in some form.Ant expert E.O.Wilson, a professor at Harvard University, once estimated the total biomass of ants on Earth is equal to that of humans.David Schwartzman, a geochemist at Howard University in Washington, D.C., who was not involved with the study, said he finds the idea plausible.\"Clearly, more studies on the role of ants and other animals populating soils are needed to broaden our understanding of their significance in global biotic enhancement of weathering,\" Schwartzman told Live Science.The aim of the study, published July 14 in the journal Geology, was to watch the minerals in basalt dissolve over time.In general, weathering of minerals plays an important role in trapping and removing carbon from Earth's atmosphere, and Dorn was interested in directly measuring this effect.About 19 months after closing down its special team of environmental reporters, the New York Times has named Adam Bryant as editor overseeing climate change and environmental issues for the paper's science coverage.Bryant announced the news on Twitter on Tuesday, noting that he will scale back his other responsibilities at the Times as part of the move.[seealso

Adam Bryant (@nytcorneroffice) September 2, 2014Bryant had been serving as a columnist for \"Corner Office,\" in which he interviewed chief executives on management and leadership.The column had run twice a week but will now run once a week, according to his Twitter post.The Times closed down its \"pod\" of seven reporters in January 2013.Then managing editor Dean Baquet, who has since taken over as the paper's executive editor, claimed that the change would not drastically impact coverage of the topic.“We can tell the story just as well without the infrastructure,” Baquet told Times public editor Margaret Sullivan.Less than three months later, the Times also closed down the \"Green\" blog, which followed energy and environmental news.Sullivan noted that the moves led to plenty of critique of the Times.Despite claims that coverage would be unaffected, a study quoted by Sullivan showed that the Times' environmental coverage dropped by about a third based on a year-over-year comparison of April to September.However, the paper continued to devote reporters to climate in the interim, including Justin Gillis and Coral Davenport, who is based in Washington.The Times has been working to keep costs down as subscription revenue growth fails to keep up with falling advertising income.The company costs roughly $363 million to operate in the second quarter of 2014, down from about $432 million in the same period of 2013.The first thing to know about the U.N.Climate Summit is that it's not a part of the formal global climate treaty negotiations.Except it sort of is.By bringing together more than 100 heads of state in New York on Sept. 23, along with CEOs and leaders from civil society organizations, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is hoping that it serves as diplomatic jumper cables to revitalize the stagnated U.N. climate treaty talks as they head into a crucial year.Climate scientists and many political leaders have warned that, because of the inertia of the climate system, tackling global warming is becoming more urgent with each passing day, and that if the world does not enact major emissions cuts by 2020, all hope of limiting global warming to at or below dangerous levels will be lost.To put it another way, the negotiations that informally kick off in New York this month could make or break the fate of many countries, species and communities worldwide.You can’t negotiate in here.This is a momentum room.After attempts to craft a top-down global climate treaty faltered in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, negotiators are now focusing on a way to back into a bottom-up agreement, starting with the non-summit summit.One way to think of the gathering is as the cocktail party ahead of a formal dinner.Participants will get to know one another, and become more familiar with their negotiating positions and points of view, before heading into the more crucial negotiations during the next 15 months.According to the U.N. Secretary-General's office, the climate summit is meant to catalyze action on climate change in part by announcing a series of commitments from the private sector and governments.\"We believe that the Climate Summit is an opportunity to approach climate change differently,” Eri Kaneko, associate spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon, told Mashable.“Instead of a negotiation, the Summit will be an opportunity for world leaders -- from governments, businesses, and civil society -- to announce what actions they will be embark on to reduce emissions and to live with the impacts of climate change.”She said the summit “will be different because it is about action and ambition.It is not about words and rhetoric.”According to Peter Ogden, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who was part of the U.S. climate negotiating team during the Copenhagen Summit, the New York meeting is part of a much longer process.“Anyone expecting a big kind of breakthrough at the summit has mismatched expectations,” he said in an interview.2009 feels like forever ago.Climate science has advanced a great deal since 2009, with the consensus that global warming is largely manmade growing stronger, and predictions becoming more dire in most cases.Scientists have warned that the world is almost out of time to prevent manmade global warming from exceeding the dangerous threshold of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels.If that threshold is exceeded, which some scientists think is almost guaranteed at this point anyway, small island states such as Kiribati and the Maldives could be overtaken by the sea and wiped off the map.Here is a sampling of some of the latest scientific findings:The rise in global average sea level since the late 1800s has been much greater than at any other time in the past 2,000 years.Since 1992, sea level has risen at twice the rate it had during the past century, decreasing the amount of time that residents of U.S. coastlines have to prepare for coastal flooding.The world is on course to see an increase in global average surface temperatures of up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century.Climate change will reduce median global crop yields by up to 2% per decade through 2100, when compared to a world without climate change.At the same time as crop yields will be challenged, crop demand will be rising by about 14% per decade until 2050, which will greatly increase food stress.If global warming reaches 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, it could lead to “global aggregate economic losses” of between 0.2% and 2.0% of GDP.(This is considered to be a conservative estimate.)Manmade global warming is responsible for nearly 70% of global glacier mass loss between 1991 to 2010.The amount of carbon dioxide in the air surpassed 400 parts per million, making it the highest in all of human history.About half of all cumulative manmade carbon-dioxide emissions between 1750 and 2010 happened during the past 40 years.Since carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for as many as 1,000 years, the cumulative emissions are what determines how much warming we’re ultimately in store for, and we’ve already burned about half of the carbon budget that would keep warming to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.The most recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that global average sea level is likely to increase by 10.2 to 32 inches by the year 2100, with a highest emissions scenario showing a sea level rise of between 21 and 38 inches by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated.Many scientists now consider this to be an underestimate.By giving countries incentives to slash their global warming emissions, the next climate treaty may be the decisive factor in setting how high sea levels will rise, how many species will go extinct, and how severe heat waves and droughts will get, among other climate change-related impacts.The international geopolitical landscape has also shifted dramatically.In 2009, the economic crisis was still battering the globe, particularly the U.S. and Europe.This constrained the ambition of these countries, due to fear of incurring high costs.In addition, in Copenhagen, America had a new, untested president in Barack Obama.In 2014, President Obama will arrive at the summit just a few months after announcing the most far-reaching climate change measures ever to be undertaken by any U.S. president.In addition, since 2009, advances in production techniques (i.e.hydraulic fracturing, also known as \"fracking\"), and economic conditions, the U.S. has shifted its electricity generation mix from coal to mainly natural gas, which has lowered the country’s emissions significantly.This also gives the country more credibility on the international stage.According to a report from the White House Council on Economic Advisers, from 2005 to 2011, the U.S. reduced its \"total carbon pollution\" more than any other country, and now comprises about 15% of global carbon emissions.Other major players are also acting on climate change.China recently announced a regional cap and trade program to cut emissions, partly due to their widely-publicized struggles with air pollution.Narendra Modi, the new prime minister of India, has indicated his desire to move forward with expanding renewable energy programs to expand the country’s electricity network.According to David Waskow, director of the international climate action initiative for the World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank, “countries have actually deepened what they are doing in very concrete ways\" since 2009.In India, for example, Waskow said that Modi “is very committed to renewable energy as a key lever -- if not the key lever -- to increasing energy access in that country.”Other countries, most notably Australia, have backtracked on climate action since 2009, dismantling programs that were put in place to limit carbon emissions or announcing that they would not meet their emissions reduction targets.Has anyone seen Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Modi?Could've sworn they were invited.There will be a few glaringly noticeable no-shows at the summit.According to news reports, China’s President Xi Jinping will not attend the summit, which is significant considering China is the world’s top emitter of global warming pollutants.In addition, India's Modi is not expected to attend, although he will meet with Obama in Washington just days later -- and climate change may come up.“Just 'cause you’re not in New York for the summit doesn’t mean you’re not talking climate change,” Ogden, of the Center for American Progress, said.The leaders of Canada and Australia, the two industrialized countries that are the current international pariahs on the climate issue (Canada for developing its oil sands resources and missing its Kyoto targets, and Australia for backtracking on its emissions regulations), are also skipping the meeting.Don’t expect a resolution to the \"what form of treaty?\"debate.The U.S. has signaled that it does not want the next climate agreement to be a top-down, binding treaty that would force the administration to submit it to the Senate for approval.Considering that the Senate has been hostile to treaties of nearly all kinds, including a U.N. treaty on protecting the disabled, the Obama administration knows the chances of getting a climate change agreement to the required two-thirds majority vote will be nearly impossible.This will especially be the case if Republicans take the Senate in 2016, which many political prognosticators consider to be the most likely outcome of midterm elections.Therefore, the U.S. negotiating team seems to be aiming for an agreement under which each country commits to taking certain actions and making specified contributions, such as climate adaptation assistance to developing countries.The U.S. is also seeking an agreement that involves the entire world, including rising developing countries that are responsible for a growing share of global warming emissions.“If you look at it,” Ogden said, “The Copenhagen Accord is sort of an example of an agreement that was not a new treaty or protocol, but instead harnessed a set of nationally self-determined set of targets.” That agreement didn’t require senate ratification.“There is precedent here,” he added.The Copenhagen Accord established emissions reduction goals for industrialized and developing countries, and enshrined into international law the goal of limiting global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or less compared to pre-industrial conditions.Nigel Purvis, the president and CEO of the consulting firm Climate Advisers, told Mashable that most agreements the U.S. agrees to on the international stage don’t need Congress’ buy-in anyway.“It’s a false choice between legally binding and not legally binding,” he said.One of the main concerns about a treaty that follows a bottom-up approach, with each country deciding for itself how much it will reduce emissions, is that at the end of the day emissions will still be high enough to take the world over the climate cliff.It's like a large group that goes out for happy hour after work, leaving one person stuck with the bill at the end of the evening.Inevitably, someone underpays, resulting in a gap between the money on the table and the check.An agreement like this, Purvis said, “has the potential to enshrine a gap in between what the science requires and what nations are doing, and that gap could actually grow.”“There is a real need for advocacy and engagement to convince countries to be as ambitious as they need to be.”Speaking of advocacy...In association with the summit, environmental groups are organizing what they are billing as the largest climate march in history, which will take place in New York on Sept. 21.BONUS: 6 Common Myths About Climate ChangeRemember the hole in the ozone layer?The one caused by refrigerants used in air conditioners and aerosol spray cans?Yeah, that never really went away.Each frigid Antarctic winter, the ozone hole has reappeared, allowing higher amounts of ultraviolet rays from the sun to reach the Earth's surface.Some years, such as in 2011, a significant hole even opens up over the Arctic, too.But finally, after years of cutting emissions of ozone-depleting substances known as Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and halons, scientists are detecting signs of recovery in the thin upper reaches of the stratosphere, according to a major U.N. report released Wednesday.In other words, that problem you may have thought was fixed is now in fact well on its way toward being fixed.But there's a catch.Many of the substances that industry used to replace the harmful CFCs, such as hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and hydroclorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, don't harm ozone, but turned out to be potent global warming gases.By using them at an increasing rate, there's a risk that gains in solving one environmental problem will inadvertently aggravate another, according to the report.“The world avoided a major problem by getting rid of ozone-depleting substances via the Montreal Protocol,” said Achim Steiner, the director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), at a press conference in New York.“We are at a critical point.\"The Montreal Protocol, a 1987 global agreement that mandated cuts to CFC emissions, has been one of the most successful environmental treaties in history.According to the report, which is the first comprehensive update in global ozone science in four years, without the Montreal Protocol and its associated incremental agreements, atmospheric levels of ozone depleting substances could have increased tenfold by 2050.The Protocol will have prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer annually by 2030, the U.N. says, in addition to averting damage to human eyes and immune systems, and protecting wildlife and agriculture that are sensitive to UV radiation.The report was the result of research by thousands of scientists around the world, and nearly 300 authors.Paul Newman, a NASA scientist who co-chairs the scientific assessment panel to the Montreal Protocol, said the stratospheric ozone layer is on the mend -- especially in the upper reaches of the stratosphere, about 30 miles up.(For comparison, jet aircraft typically cruise at about six to eight miles high.)These gains took decades of emissions reductions, however, illustrating how long it can take to solve a global environmental problem.In fact, as recently as the turn of the century, while CFC emissions were decreasing, the ozone hole was still increasing.The ozone hole didn't reach its peak size until 2006, when it was a whopping 10.6 million square miles, according to NASA.This is because CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances take many years to break down after reaching the stratosphere.The report says the Antarctic ozone hole will continue to occur each spring throughout the century, even after CFC and halon emissions cease altogether.\"We now have the early hints that the ozone layer may be healing itself,\" Newman said.The report predicts that stratospheric ozone should return to its 1980 level, which predates the decline in ozone, by about the year 2030.Because CFCs warm the climate, the Montreal Protocol helped fight climate change -- although that was never its intent, Steiner said.On the other hand, emissions from their replacements, HFCs, are increasing by 7% per year.If this trend continues, Steiner says, we could have a “major challenge in terms of global warming” by 2050.Numerous countries, including the U.S., are negotiating within the Montreal Protocol talks to enact limits on HFCs, but no binding reductions have been passed yet.There is a risk, Steiner says, that \"by solving one problem, we will amplify another one.”HFCs may be a topic of discussion at the upcoming UN Climate Summit in New York on September 23.A.R.(Ravi) Ravishankara, who also co-chairs the scientific assessment, said that there is a risk that countries could enact curbs in carbon dioxide emissions to reduce global warming, but neglect to slash HFCs.\"If you continue to emit HFCs, it could easily offset all the work you have done,\" he said.Alternatives to HFCs, which have less of an impact on the climate, could instead be used, if the Montreal Protocol is amended to encourage their production and distribution.The United Nations Secretary-General's daylong Climate Summit in New York on Sept. 23 will draw about 120 heads of state, and many lower-ranking officials, according to a list of speakers the U.N. released this week.President Barack Obama will attend on behalf of the U.S., but China and India -- the first and third-largest emitters of carbon dioxide -- will be represented by lower-level officials.Carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas that is causing global warming, stayed at or above 400 parts per million for several months in 2014 -- the highest it has been in human history.A single molecule of carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds to a thousand years, which makes the problem particularly challenging to solve.China is sending Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli as a special envoy of President Xi Jinping, according to Xinhua.\"The Chinese side will participate in the summit and related activities in a constructive manner,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the state-run media outlet.\"The Chinese side expects to join efforts with the international community to push for positive results in the summit, advance international cooperation on climate change and contribute to addressing climate change.\"The U.N. document says leaders will be given speaking slots that are just four minutes long, although Xinhua reported that a \"keynote address\" will be given by China's Zhang, suggesting a longer speaking allotment.India, the third-largest emitter behind the U.S., is sending its environment minister to the meeting instead of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi.However, Modi is traveling to Washington several days after the summit to meet with Obama, and climate change is expected to be one of the issues they discuss.Many countries, including Australia, Russia, Pakistan and Ukraine will be represented by their foreign ministers, while other nations, such as Canada, are sending their environment ministers.Notably, Saudi Arabia, whose economy depends on its oil exports, is sending its petroleum minister to the environmental meeting.With leaders facing a deadline of 2015 to negotiate a new climate agreement that will be enforced in 2020, the summit is seen as a momentum builder ahead of formal negotiations.It will be the largest gathering of world leaders to discuss climate change since the Copenhagen Summit in 2009, and depending on the final guest list, it may even draw more leaders than that meeting.The Climate Summit will bring together political leaders, business executives and representatives of nongovernmental organizations.Those involved in the planning say that a series of commitments in the areas of emissions cuts and financial contributions will likely be announced.The announcements will be aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation and promoting climate action in the world's cities, among other goals, according to a release.It is supposed to be different this time.The United Nations Climate Summit, which kicks off next Tuesday, Sept. 23, in New York City, is designed to break through two decades of stymied efforts to reach a binding global agreement to reduce greenhouse gases, even as the world rapidly approaches the point of no return to prevent catastrophic climate change.For the first time since the failed 2009 negotiations in Copenhagen, world leaders — more than 120 are expected to attend — will gather to hammer out a way forward in the run-up to the next big round of climate change talks in Paris in December 2015.Unlike those formal proceedings, called the Conference of the Parties, next Tuesday’s event in New York involves no negotiations and no bitter disputes between developed and developing countries over obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions and who should pay the cost.Instead, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon summoned political leaders, titans of industry and environmental activists to discuss concrete solutions and build public support for actions related to agriculture, energy, carbon markets, transportation and other issues.Even representatives from the oil and gas industries are expected to participate.“People who pull the levers of the global economy will be in this building,” Robert Orr, assistant secretary-general for policy coordination and strategic planning, said at a press conference at the U.N. on Tuesday.“When they speak with a unified voice in this area, it has a real impact in the political realm.”The summit will kick off with What’s Possible, a video on solutions to climate change narrated by Morgan Freeman.(A preview is below.)World leaders will then give a series of four-minute speeches before individual sessions begin on climate-related topics.Look for big announcements from big corporations on climate change initiatives as well as policy moves by governments, such as the Obama administration’s anticipated announcement that it has reached agreements with Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honeywell, DuPont, and other companies to cut emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas.“It’s the beginning of new coalitions — not only governments but the private sector — of civil society, mobilizing ambitious action around sectors that are in these high-impact areas,” Selwin Hart, director of the secretary-general’s climate change support team, said at the press conference.Much has changed since the Copenhagen conference in 2009.Over the past five years, renewable energy has grown from a niche market to a multibillion-dollar business.Cities, states and nations, meanwhile, have taken matters into their own hands, implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.In June, for instance, the Obama administration moved to slash carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants by 30 percent.China has started rolling out regional carbon-trading markets as it becomes the world’s biggest installer of renewable energy systems.“There is change afoot,” said Orr.“Part of it is the hard reality of economics.Many industries will die if they don’t change.Now the economics of the energy sphere have fundamentally changed.”Talk is one thing; action is another.The question is whether political and business leaders will follow through with the grand pronouncements they make and keep the pressure building for action in the lead-up to the Paris negotiations next year.On Sunday, more than 100,000 people are expected to march through Manhattan to goad the U.N. to take action.Still, there’s an air of optimism missing from recent climate change discussions.In a rare move, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will join the more than 100,000 protesters expected to gather in New York on Sunday to push for countries to take action against manmade global warming.The \"People's Climate March\" comes just two days ahead of a climate summit that Ban is leading in New York, where more than 120 heads of state, as well as business leaders and members of civil-society organizations are expected to discuss plans for a new global warming treaty.The Secretary-General's office confirmed Ban's participation Thursday morning in an email to Mashable, after he commented about it without clarifying whether he was speaking metaphorically.\"I will link arms with those marching for climate action,” Ban told a press conference.“We stand with them on the right side of this key issue for our common future.”Ban said he wants the summit to be a momentum builder, rather than a formal negotiating session, and the march is designed to provide a boost of grassroots energy ahead of that crucial meeting.(In other words, the march is a momentum builder for the momentum builder.)\"The Climate Summit that I am convening one week from today has two goals: to mobilize political will for a universal and meaningful climate agreement next year in Paris; and second to generate ambitious steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience,\" he said at the press conference.\"This is not going to be a negotiation.But, whatever agreement or understanding will be made here, will be reflected in the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] negotiation process.\"The Secretary-General's participation is unusual, since high-ranking global leaders tend not to participate in public demonstrations.It opens up the possibility that other leaders, such as those from small island states who are facing an existential threat from climate change, could also participate.Heads of state are already in New York to participate in the U.N. General Assembly that takes place before the Climate Summit on Tuesday.Prominent global warming activists are also slated to appear, including former U.S. vice-president Al Gore, who told Mashable that he sees the protest as a sign that global warming is moving from the realm of science and policy into \"one of the historic and powerful social movements, and in some ways the biggest social movement on a global basis that we have ever seen.\"The June through August period was the warmest such period on Earth since record-keeping began in 1880, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Thursday.In addition, the month of August was the warmest such month on record since 1880 as well, and featured the warmest ocean temperatures ever recorded for any month.Both of these records, NOAA says, were driven in large part by unusually warm ocean temperatures around the world.In fact, global average ocean temperatures were so high in August -- 1.17 degrees Fahrenheit above average, to be exact -- that they broke the all-time record set just two months ago.These temperature records, along with others, have set the world on course to have its warmest year on record, NOAA said.The NOAA said record warmth was observed across much of the central and western equatorial Pacific Ocean, as well as parts of the western Indian Ocean, especially in the vicinity of Madagascar.The NOAA data matches information NASA released earlier in the week using slightly different methods of analyzing temperature data, which also found that August was the warmest such month on record.These announcements are especially significant because this warmth is occurring in the absence of a declared El Niño event in the Pacific.Such events feature unusually warm ocean temperatures and tend to turbocharge the warming already occurring due to manmade greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.For example, El Niño events in 1998 and 2005 led to those years sticking out in global temperature records as the warmest years on record.The fact that the planet is so warm without an El Niño around to boost temperatures is a sign that global warming has become so noticeable that an El Niño event is no longer needed to set all-time records like this.The year-to-date is running as the third-warmest year in NOAA's records, but NOAA said that if 2014 maintains the current departure from average (about 1.22 degrees Fahrenheit) for the rest of the year, \"it will be the warmest year on record.\"Currently, NOAA is predicting a weak to moderate El Niño to develop this fall and winter, which could lead to 2014 or 2015 being declared the new warmest year on record.The new temperature data also comes just before one of the largest gatherings of world leaders ever to take place on the subject of global warming.The daylong U.N.Climate Summit will be held in New York on Sept. 23.Climate change: It's as important a topic as it is polarizing.And it's a conversation that needs to happen now -- in fact, a new report states that the next 15 years could determine the fate of the Earth's climate.The conversation of climate change, and what we can do to slow its effects, is one of the most prominent topics of this year's Social Good Summit, with multiple panels on the agenda.Leading up to the Summit, LinkedIn asked its Influencers to share insights on some of the world's biggest social good conversations.Here are excerpts of what six of these thought leaders, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank President Jim Kim, had to say about the climate change issue.Ban Ki-moon -- Secretary-General, United Nations\"Climate change is the defining issue of our time.It’s real, it’s happening now and its impacts are being felt everywhere.Options for limiting climate change are still available, but only if we act now and on a grand scale.The more we delay, the more it will cost us later on.\"Read Ban's full LinkedIn Influencer piece.David Kenny -- Chairman & CEO, The Weather Company\"It strikes me that the greatest deterrent to meaningful progress against climate change is not a powerful cabal of special interest

upwards of 100,000 people are expected to take to the streets of New York City in a worldwide climate protest that organizers say will be the largest and most diverse in history.If these numbers prove correct, then the \"People's Climate March\" will likely mark the moment when global warming transitions from being a science and policy issue into a full-fledged social movement.Perhaps it will become as large as the gay rights and civil rights movements.But even if it doesn't, it could play a crucial part in changing the political environment on this seemingly intractable issue.As a sign of the march’s import, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will “lock arms” with protesters in New York, a highly unusual step for a someone in his leadership position.The march is intended to help build the social movement while also prodding world leaders to make meaningful commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when more than 120 of them gather at a U.N.Climate Summit that Ban is hosting on Tuesday.\"This march is going to have a serious political impact, maybe not today, but certainly in the months and years to come,\" said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for the environmental group 350.org, which has taken a leading role organizing the event.Right now, six busloads of Minnesota climate activists are on their way to New York, along with a “climate train” that set out from California and picked up activists during its trek across the country.At least 3,000 college students are slated to turn out from New York area universities alone.Around the world, more than 2,000 events are scheduled for Sunday as well.In total, about 100 million people globally will be represented, according to the organizing committee overseeing preparations.“The scale of organizing for the march now rivals that of a major electoral campaign,” the organizing committee said in a press release.Former Vice President Al Gore, the person most identified with the climate change issue-to-date, told Mashable that the climate march signifies the development of something that's absolutely necessary in order for leaders to take the actions needed to combat the threat of global warming.“The climate movement is becoming one of the historic and powerful social movements, and, in some ways, the biggest social movement on a global basis that we have ever seen,” Gore said.“It is still in its early years.Many people have been at it for a long time, some of them a lot longer than me, and yet for the mass of people, it is just now becoming a social movement that it must be in order to prevail.”Gore said he will also be marching on Sunday.The People's Climate March is backed by an unprecedented coalition of 45 major labor groups, including heavy hitters such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) -- a group that Henn said \"doesn’t mess around\" -- along with prominent grassroots environmental organizations like 350.org as well as religious organizations.More than 1,400 businesses are also part of the coalition.In interviews with Mashable, leaders of the organizing committee as well as grassroots organizers said they see this march as a seminal moment that will be looked back upon as an inflection point on the road to combating global warming and advancing climate justice.Henn, whose organization has led the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline during the past few years, told Mashable that this event will be a milestone in the burgeoning climate movement.\"This is a show of power that i think will continue to reverberate,” Henn said.“This is a battle with many fronts and we’re beginning to assemble a movement that can work at all those different levels.”The diversity of the groups involved in the march, Henn said, ensures that many different perspectives will be heard -- from union workers concerned about ensuring the growth of the clean tech economy in the U.S., to nurses who are already seeing the impacts of hotter and longer heat waves.“Not everyone will start their sentences with global warming, but they’re all pushing for the same thing,” Henn said.“It really is a big tent moment to show there is a big constituency taking action.”Clearing the political space to enable actionAs Gore hints, many who have been in the trenches on climate change issues over the past several years believe that the issue needs a social movement built around it in order to pave the way for action.Without such a groundswell to support politicians who are pushing climate-friendly policies that can threaten powerful interests, such as the oil and gas industry, those policies will continue to languish.“They can’t make progress without a strong social movement clearing the way for them,” Henn said.In fact, many of the activists taking part in Sunday’s march think traditional environmental groups that have played a key role in policy fights in Washington, D.C., are part of the problem, rather than the solution.They view the failure to pass climate legislation in Congress in 2009 and 2010 as a demonstration of the limits of traditional inside-the-beltway engagement in which big environmental groups, like Environmental Defense, specialize.These activists see climate justice, which incorporates other issues like racial and economic disparities, as being off these groups’ agenda.Jihan Gearon, who works on environmental issues at Navajo reservations in New Mexico, where energy development and unemployment are both rampant, said the march will feature “a lot more different kinds of groups than you usually would see” at such an event.Protest organizers raised enough money -- they didn’t disclose how much, but their goal was about $10 million, according to one organizer -- to help subsidize travel costs for march participants from around the world.Laura Hanson Schlachter, a local organizer for 350.org in Madison, Wisconsin, said her group is sending three buses and members via the climate train, bringing the Wisconsin contingent to about 150 people.“Climate issues affect everyone, and this is the first time, I think, that we’ve created an invitation for everyone to be part of the issue,” said Schlachter.“Our global leaders are crucial and we want them to do the right thing on Tuesday,” she said, referring to the climate summit.In 2014 alone, our planet has seen the hottest August on record, the western U.S. got snow in September, the Southwest saw record rainfall, Pakistan had flash floods and the U.S. bundled up for polar vortices (even in July!).And that's just a fraction of the climatological effects humans are experiencing on a daily basis.[seealso URL=\"mashable.com/2014/09/18/al-gore-is-hopeful-global-warming/\"]Climate change is real.And while you may hear the statistics and see some effects of climate change in your own backyard, sometimes pictures really are worth a thousand words.The photos below show places on earth that have taken a beating because of climate change.The images compare these locations to other points throughout history -- sometimes more than 100 years prior, and sometimes just a few years prior.1.Alps GlacierThe Aletsch Glacier, the largest glacier in the Alps, in 1890 and 2003.Like all glaciers on earth, is retreating, at an average rate of 3% per year.Between 1850 and 2005, the Aletsch Glacier's surface area shrank 40%, and the volume shrank by 60%, according to the Swiss Academy of Sciences.2.Colorado wildfireTrevor Lane in Colorado Springs, Colorado, before and after the Waldo Canyon fire ripped through the area in 2012.Climate change means wildfire seasons are longer,

philanthropists, politicians and climate experts joined the People's Climate March in Manhattan on Sunday, bringing even more attention to a protest attended by 310,000 people.From Mark Ruffalo and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and former Vice President Al Gore, the notable attendees had their portraits snapped and shared across social media.Here we present the images captured by Mashable photographers, as well as those curated from around the web.[nggallery id=\"18765\" layout=\"list\" title=\"top\"]If we look at the hard facts of climate change, science is telling us we're running out of time.That's what Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said during a panel at the 2014 Social Good Summit on Sunday.Moderated by Mashable's senior climate reporter Andrew Freedman, the panel focused on what actions we're taking to make cities more resilient in the face of climate-related extremes over the next 15 years.Prepping society for increased climate change and extreme weather, as well as addressing mitigation challenges, is a difficult task -- but there's still hope.\"The hard numbers don't tell a great story -- but underneath that story, there are literally thousands of stories of people trying to build a different future,\" Steiner said.Indeed, as Steiner spoke, more than 300,000 people gathered in New York City for the People's Climate March, calling for action against global warming.Thousands of others joined similar marches around the world.Steiner added that we need to live in a climate-neutral world -- and with every year that passes, that becomes more difficult.But he emphasized a need to shift our focus away from exact timing.\"There is not one date ... We have the choice, we have the opportunity, and that, I think, is the moment we need to seize,\" he said.Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa, has made efforts to seize that very moment.Mayor Mpho Parks Tau, who also sat on Sunday's panel, explained how his city has conducted detailed analyses and projections in order to better secure its infrastructure during extreme weather events.But it's also about better preparing communities, he said.Fellow panelist Seth Schultz discussed his work as director of research, measurement and planning at the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.C40 is a collaboration of 59 cities around world, including Johannesburg, working together on climate change.\"The amount of action cities are taking, both to mitigate and to adapt, has more than doubled in a two-year timeframe,\" Schultz said.\"Our most recent study ... [showed] that cities have taken over 1,000 actions to address the issue [of risk].\"They're doing this out of necessity, but voluntarily helping and collaborating with each other, and the impact they're having is quite significant.\"Since climate change is such a complex issue, C40 is working on an initiative called the Climate Risk Assessment Framework and Tool \"to help create a taxonomy of the hazards that cities face -- and to do it in a very consistent matter, to allow for a much more intuitive connection between the cities on helping address these issues,\" Schultz said.Companies like Solazyme, whose CEO and cofounder Jonathan Wolfson also spoke on Sunday, are working toward solutions, too.\"Our goal was, initially, to simply make low-carbon, renewable fuels,\" Wolfson said.\"But as we started to work with fuels, we realized if we were making oils, we could address a much more substantial array of problems, including food security, nutrition and the pressures on fragile equatorial ecosystems.\"He said real progress requires cities to take initiative, organizations like the U.N. to set an example and companies to make innovative solutions.The last 20 years have seen major growth in how many people approach the #climatechange discussion: http://t.co/1QsnhjEPBH #2030NOW— Mashable Social Good (@socialgood) September 21, 2014Sept. 23 will mark the U.N.Climate Summit, when more than 100 heads of state, CEOs and other leaders will begin discussing actions toward a potential climate treaty.The event is intended to build momentum toward the U.N.Climate Change Conference, which takes place in Paris in 2015.Steiner thinks the fact that so many people are set to attend the Climate Summit on Tuesday is progress itself.\"You often have the sense that in the United Nations, we are associated with the inability to act,\" he said.\"But what you will actually see on Tuesday is a Secretary-General stepping out in front of the world, when many others are sitting back.\"But it isn't just about leadership -- it's about a grassroots approach, and having the courage to speak about the issue when it's hardest to do so.\"Let's be very clear: Tuesday is not about just having everybody step up,\" Steiner said.\"It's about giving a spotlight [to] those who are willing to step out of their comfort zone, take responsibility and lead us into the 21st century with these answers.\"[wp_scm_comment][wp_scm_sgs_2014]Environmental activists called for people to gather on the streets of their cities on Sunday to march in a coordinated worldwide protest, in hopes that it would mark a turning point for global warming.Ahead of the United Nations Climate Summit in New York City, more than 300,000 people, including celebrities and politicians, descended on Manhattan for the so-called People's Climate March.The organizers of the protest tweeted this video shot with a drone that probably gives the best view of the crowd gathered near Central Park, where the march started.The pictures below give an idea of just how many people turned out in support of the global protest, which may well make history as the largest environmental demonstration ever.[nggallery id=18769 layout=\"list\"]More than 300,000 people gathered in New York on Sunday, and at hundreds of events worldwide, to call for action against global warming and other environmental issues.The People’s Climate March originally expected to draw around 100,000 people.The United Nations Climate Summit, set to take place two days later on Tuesday in New York, will feature more than 120 heads of state, along with business leaders and representatives from civil society groups.At the summit, the U.S. is expected to announce several new initiatives to help developing countries increase their resilience to climate change and reduce their emissions, as well as tout the progress made domestically in cutting emissions in recent years, according to the White House.Read Mashable's latest updates on the People's Climate March, below:REPORTERS AND EDITORS IN NEW YORK: Andrew Freedman (@afreedma), Bianca Consunji (@BiancaConsunji), Evan Engel (@EvanEngel), Liz Pierson (@Liz_Pierson), Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai (@LorenzoFB) | EDITORS IN TORONTO: Anita Li (@neeeda)When thousands of people worldwide gathering to call for action against global warming, you're going to get some interesting characters.From puns and word play to ornate costumes, protesters made their voices heard at the People's Climate March on Sunday.We've gathered a handful of shining examples, below, and will continue to update this list as the event continuesA day after an estimated 310,000 people took to the streets of New York to call for action to combat global warming, Secretary of State John Kerry along with other high-ranking officials sought to harness the momentum, saying the U.N.Climate Summit on Tuesday offers a crucial opportunity for making progress.Speaking at the launch event for The Climate Group's annual Climate Week NYC, Kerry compared climate change to other transnational threats the U.S. is facing, including terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"Too often climate change is put into an environmental challenge box,\" Kerry said.The Climate Group is a nonprofit that works with corporate and government partners to promote clean energy innovation and policy solutions.According to Kerry, the world is going in the wrong direction on this issue, with greenhouse gas emissions skyrocketing, with dire scientific warnings about the consequences.“Despite the scientific consensus we are still collectively allowing this problem to grow, not diminish.”“Truth is,\" Kerry said, \"we are not meeting the challenge.”He cited the recent report that 2013 saw the largest single increase in carbon pollution in 20 years.“It is about time that world leaders come to the UN to recognize this threat in the way that it requires and demands.”According to Kerry, the world is on course for a far bigger amount of climate change than what world leaders have agreed to in order to avert the most dangerous consequences.“What is so disturbing about this is that the worst impacts can still be prevented … if we make the right set of choices.”Kerry said the climate issue is “so extraordinarily frustrating” to work on because there are economic opportunities that countries and companies can seize upon in creating and deploying new technologies, yet the issue is often framed as an economic loser.“Common sense is not particularly common right now,” Kerry said.According to Kerry, the U.S. and China have made considerable progress in addressing their carbon emissions, which together add up to about 45% of all the world's emissions.China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the primary long-lived global warming pollutant.The U.S. occupies the number two spot.He recalled his experience in the Senate, where he had 55 votes rounded up to pass a climate bill, but was thwarted in part due to an advertising blitz from the coal industry \"to scare people\" that it would raise energy costs.Speaking to business leaders in the audience, which included the CEO of Unilever, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and many others, Kerry said, “Everyone here needs to think hard about the relationship of campaign contributions to outcomes,” which was a clear reference to companies that donate funds to lawmakers that oppose climate action.Ban Ki-moon: I am overwhelmed by power, energy & voice of #PeoplesClimate March http://t.co/WdScu6CH4P pic.twitter.com/GtR3L78r6S #climate2014— United Nations (@UN) September 21, 2014\"It costs more to avoid and obfuscate\" global warming than it does to address it through low carbon energy sources and emissions cuts, he said.He cited a report released on Sept. 16 that found that the world has about 10 years to ensure that about $90 trillion in infrastructure investments go toward cleaner technologies, otherwise carbon emissions will be so high that it would guarantee the world will greatly exceed the 3.6 degree Fahrenheit increase in global average temperatures, compared to preindustrial levels.(Warming greater than that may have a much higher risk of causing irreversible, potentially devastating impacts.)U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon talked about his experience marching with demonstrators on Sunday, and said he wished more leaders had been there.“In my life I have never participated in that kind of a mass rally,” Ban said.“I will not be able to describe exactly what I felt and what I saw,\" he said.“We had to speak against some of our leaders who are not doing enough.“...The leaders of the world should have been there and listened to all of these yearnings and aspirations by all of these people, people on the street.”Businesses working to bolster support for climate negotiationsThe Climate Group's event showcased businesses that are taking steps to reduce their emissions, with the launch of a new initiative to spur 100 companies to go carbon neutral -- meaning that they would have no net carbon dioxide emissions -- by the year 2020.The initiative, known as \"RE 100,\" which is a joint initiative of The Climate Group and the Carbon Disclosure Project, has attracted H&M, Mars, Nestle, Philips, Reed Elsevier, IKEA, DuPont and Swiss Re as launch companies, among others.The Climate Group also launched a program known as \"We Mean Business,\" which joins organizations that work with influential businesses and investors to help transition to a low-carbon economy.A report from this initiative shows the economic benefits for businesses that address global warming.Separately, the World Bank announced that 73 national and 11 regional governments, along with 1,000 companies and investors have committed to support putting a price on carbon emissions, a key early step toward regulating greenhouse gases, ahead of the Climate Summit.The supporters include China, Russia and the E.U., as well as Nokia, LG Electronics, Lego and Shell.\"By supporting a price on carbon, leaders from across the political and business world have come together to send a strong signal that they will build their economies for a safer, cleaner, and more prosperous planet,” said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group, in a press release.“Today we see real momentum.\"BONUS: 6 Common Myths About Climate ChangeScientists first noticed the dangerous effects of carbon dioxide emissions back in 1896; the press started reporting on rising temperatures in 1930.And yet, more than 80 years later, the nations of the world still haven't passed sufficient legislature to curtail the disastrous effects humans have on the planet.Recent studies show that the next 15 years of climate-related decisions, says Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, will \"determine the future of the world.\"The message is clear: If we don’t implement the difficult but necessary changes to reduce the effects of climate change, it will be all but impossible to turn back.Because climate change is on everyone's lips and top of mind during UN Week, we created the timeline below to provide some background on climate change and the policies and movements that have attempted to keep it in check.From first recognized Earth Day and rising carbon dioxide levels to legislation like the Montreal Protocol, a flip through the timeline below will help you wrap your head around the importance of this week's summit -- and its impact on the future of our planet.One day after a huge climate march in New York City, activists gathered on Wall Street Monday to protest what they say is corporate and economic institutions' role in the climate crisis.The protesters, many dressed in blue, scheduled a rally in Battery Park before marching to the financial district in Lower Manhattan, according to organizers of the protest, #FloodWallStreet.Watch it live:Broadcast live streaming video on UstreamOrganizers said in a press release that the sit-in aimed to disrupt business in the financial district by targeting \"corporate polluters and those profiting from the fossil fuel industry.\"\"Two years ago, Superstorm Sandy literally flooded New York's financial district, but it didn't faze Wall Street and their drive for the short term profits that flow from the cooking of the planet,\" activist Naomi Klein said in a statement.\"Which is why we're going to flood them again.\"Dressed in a green wig and superhero outfit, protester Jenna DeBoisblanc, an environmental activist from New Orleans, Louisiana, said at a rally in a park near Wall Street before the protest that those assembled were expecting arrests at the sit-in.\"I think arrests in particular are a very good way of conveying the gravity of an issue,\" she said.\"If you're willing to risk arrest it certainly demonstrates that it's something very urgent.\"Aside from the arrests, organizers expect a 15-foot inflatable \"carbon bubble\" (which police popped), a marching band, puppets, a 300-foot #FloodWallStreet banner and other \"large-scale art pieces.\"Sit-in started, voices rising in unison #FloodWallStreet pic.twitter.com/X5aIszDyvM— Joanna Burgess (@Stanks) September 22, 2014The People's Climate March on September 21 drew an incredible 310,000 protestors to the streets of New York, with tens of thousands of people taking part in action elsewhere on the planet.The march was held ahead of Tuesday's U.N.Climate Summit, which will be the largest gathering of heads of state ever to discuss global warming.The march drew people from as close as New York City to as far away as Europe and Africa, and a diverse array of interests were represented.But when Mashable spoke to participants, a number of consistent theme emerged -- such as the urgency of addressing the climate change issue, the desire to preserve the planet for future generations and the need for world leaders to take action at the Climate Summit, which starts on Tuesday.Police and climate-change activists clashed on Wall Street on Monday during a protest over corporate and economic institutions' role in the climate crisis.Hundreds of activists gathered in Lower Manhattan's financial district for \"Flood Wall Street,\" where they chanted, carried signs and — in some places — sat down in the street.At one point, activists struggled with police to gain control of metal barricades.At least one man appeared to be taken away in handcuffs after the incident, and an NYPD official threw three punches (as seen in the video above at 2:29).Protestors wrestled barricades away from police, who fought them, said Mashable's Evan Engel, who was at the protest.\"At one point the demonstrators opened up a 10-foot gap, but few seemed willing to charge through it.The crowd simmered and the cops regained control of the barricades.\"These 2 guys are taunting the cops #FloodWallStreet pic.twitter.com/jN6wwOta9C— Evan Engel (@evanengel) September 22, 2014There were reports of some isolated arrests of protesters, who police said did not obtain a permit for the rally.But by and large, the police, office workers and tourists watched alike as the activists chanted: \"We can't take this climate heat; we've got to shut down Wall Street,\" and bounced two large, inflatable balloons meant to represent carbon dioxide bubbles, which police later punctured.There were also reports that police had used pepper spray on protesters.Police pepper spray #FloodWallStreet demonstrators (photos via @ajplus video) pic.twitter.com/JlVfMGdGXZ— Rachael P (@plussone) September 22, 2014The video below appears to show an NYPD officer holding a spray canister.Ben Shapiro, an urban farmer and bread maker from Youngstown, Ohio, said he didn't participate in Sunday's march but came specifically on Monday because he's concerned about fracking, a technique that cracks open rock layers to free natural gas, and feels the financial system enables pollution.Crowd chanting \"We are unstoppable, another world is possible\" #FloodWallStreet pic.twitter.com/Vmy3tdZcpJ— Evan Engel (@evanengel) September 22, 2014\"I wanted to come specifically to disrupt Wall Street because it's Wall Street that's fueling this,\" said Shapiro, while sitting next to the famed bull statute on Broadway.\"I'm going after the source of the problem.... That means actively having to confront the system.\"Dressed in a green wig and superhero outfit, protester Jenna DeBoisblanc said at a rally in a park near Wall Street before the protest that those assembled were expecting arrests at the sit-in.\"I think arrests in particular are a very good way of conveying the gravity of an issue,\" said DeBoisblanc, an environmental activist from New Orleans.\"If you're willing to risk arrest it certainly demonstrates that it's something very urgent.\"UNITED NATIONS -- China, the world's biggest emitter of the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide, pledged on Tuesday to slow the rise of its emissions and reach a peak \"as soon as possible.\"Speaking at the U.N.Climate Summit in New York, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli gave hints of both progress and pitfalls ahead.The summit, at more than 120 officials above the level of foreign minister, is the largest gathering of heads of state ever assembled on this topic.(International talks on climate change are kicking into high gear in the lead- to a pivotal conference in Paris next year.)On the one hand, as far as environmentalists and the Obama administration are concerned, the mere mention of a peak in China's carbon dioxide emissions was new and ambitious, considering how quickly the Chinese economy has grown in recent years and how fast emissions have risen as well.During the past decade, for example, China saw about 10% per year increases in carbon dioxide emissions, although that slowed in 2013, according to a report from the European Commission.China has a goal to reduce its carbon intensity, which is a way of measuring the carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product, by up to 45% by 2020.Zhang said that China will reveal its goals for reducing emissions post-2020 during the first quarter of 2015, as the United States also intends to do.Zhang said that in 2013, carbon intensity dropped by nearly 29% from the 2005 level, and that installed renewable energy capacity increased significantly as well.“Responding to climate change is what China needs to do to attain sustainable development at home,” Zhang told the throngs of dignitaries, corporate titans and representatives of civil society groups at the U.N.“As a responsible major developing country China will make an even greater effort to address climate change,” he said.According to Zhang, the post-2020 plan will include goals \"to markedly reduce carbon intensity, increase the share of non-fossil fuels,\" boost forest conservation and \"we will also try to bring about the peaking of total carbon dioxide emissions as early as possible.”This means that China will work to have its absolute emissions (not the carbon intensity) hit a ceiling, and presumably go down from that point forward.On the other hand, China signaled its continued support for a long-running source of tension between industrialized countries and developing nations regarding the U.N. climate treaty process.The U.N.Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was negotiated in 1992, well before China's emissions overtook U.S. emissions, mandates that developing countries and industrialized nations have \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" in addressing the problem.In 2009, for the first time, China and other developing countries committed to taking action to reduce their emissions along with industrialized countries, but it remains to be seen how far they are willing to go when the next treaty is negotiated in 2015.That treaty is due to go into effect by 2020.Zhang said he wants to stick to the original treaty concept, which would recognize that industrialized countries caused most of the climate change to date via the industrial revolution, while countries like the U.S. are seeking to place more emphasis on the current emissions of the global community as well as the fact that most future emissions will come from rapidly developing countries like China and India.“All countries need to follow the path of green- and low-carbon development that suits their national conditions,\" Zhang said.He called upon industrialized countries to \"truly intensify emissions reduction and fulfill their obligations of financial support and tech transfer.\"In a press conference following Zhang's speech, Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters that China is conducting research into how soon its emissions can peak and cannot yet be specific about a date.Xie said China recognizes that it needs to act based on its own best interests due to climate change impacts and air pollution hazards it is already experiencing.\"We are doing it for our own sake,” Xie said.Asked to elaborate about Zhang's references to the unequal obligations of developing countries versus industrialized countries, which is a concept known as \"common but differentiated responsibilities,\" Xie said this principle \"must be followed\" by any subsequent treaty.The World Resources Institute (WRI) is a Washington think tank that pays close attention to China's climate policies.In a statement, Jennifer Morgan of WRI lauded China's message to the Climate Summit, saying, “China’s remarks at the Climate Summit go further than ever before.Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli’s announcement to strive to peak emissions ‘as early as possible’ is a welcome signal for the cooperative action we need for the Paris Agreement.Peaking emissions is vital to curb climate change and to rein in dangerous air pollution.\"Bill McKibben, environmentalist, founder of 350.org and the man behind the massive People's Climate March on Sept. 21, doesn't think much is going to come of the U.N.Climate Summit on Tuesday.Rather, he thinks it's part of testing how much pressure we can put on the systems in place, like Sunday's march and Monday's #FloodWallStreet protests, which called for action against corporate and economic institutions' roles in climate change.\"These guys [national government leaders] have had 25 years to respond, and they've essentially not responded,\" McKibben said at the 2014 Social Good Summit on Monday.\"The thought that they're going to start doing so now in some significant way seems fairly slim to me.\"McKibben sat on a panel with Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International, to discuss climate justice and propelling the movement forward.Two members of the band Linkin Park also joined the panel, moderated by Mashable's senior climate reporter, Andrew Freedman.It bothers McKibben that there will be \"pious rhetoric around climate change with very little action,\" but it doesn't deter the movement.\"We know that there is a tipping point here, politically -- just like there is climatically -- where if we can change the zeitgeist enough, get enough people not just concerned but pissed off about what's going on, then there's a certain point at which they will come to fear us as much as they fear the power of the fossil fuel industry,\" he said.\"That will be the tipping point at which we begin to see real progress.\"In terms of expectations, Naidoo shared McKibben's sentiments, saying we'll see a \"massive dose of verbal diarrhea\" over the next few days, or otherwise witness \"quasi-intellectual masturbation.\"\"I think it has to be put that way because, as Bill says, the writing has been on the wall for so long,\" Naidoo added.\"So, yes, we will continue to push inside ... We'll be pushing individual governments and so on.But nothing that Bill and I could say to them they don't know.Nothing that we could say to them their own scientists have not told them.\"\"The time for words is over,\" Naidoo said to the leaders gathering at the Climate Summit.Despite the understandable cynicism, McKibben did say that the past few days have brought \"great news,\" because of the sheer number of people who showed up to the Climate March and those who were arrested on Wall Street for taking a stand.Furthermore, the Rockefeller family -- the original oil fortune in the U.S. -- pledged to divest from fossil fuels on Monday.\"We've known what to do for 25 years and we haven't done it.Now, we're going to do something,\" McKibben said.\"The question is, at this point, whether we can do something fast enough for it to matter.And that's an open scientific question, and it depends on how much we're willing to stand up to power [and] how fast.\"[wp_scm_comment][wp_scm_sgs_2014]NEW YORK -- On the heels of Sunday's People's Climate March, thousands of activists swarmed Wall Street on Monday in a protest of financial injustice and climate change.The protesters, using tactics gleaned from the Occupy Wall Street movement, closed down the streets surrounding the iconic Charging Bull statue for most of the day.An early afternoon attempt to take Wall Street resulted in a small scuffle with police, who briefly fired pepper spray from behind steel barricades (see footage below).\"This is the center of corporate capitalism and global speculation, which is ravaging not only the ecosystem, but destroying the lives of working men and women around the globe,\" said author Chris Hedges, who helped organize the protest.\"So it's kind of the place to be.\"Hedges, along with fellow author Naomi Klein, lent a certain anti-authoritarian element to the rally that was glaringly absent from the People's Climate March.That march, which went heavy on messages of saving the climate and light on messages of blame, featured appearances from U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The Wall Street protest was timed for the eve of the U.N.Climate Summit, where several companies, including Norwegian oil producer Statoil, have endorsed a carbon price.By nightfall on Monday, a few hundred protesters remained.The NYPD made 104 arrests.Jon Stewart can't believe he has to explain melting ice to Congress.The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology interrogated Presidential Science Advisor John Holdren last week about climate change.Naturally, the Daily Show host had a few choice words for certain Congressional members present at the meeting.But it was one comment from Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman that pushed Stewart over the edge.\"I mean think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.This is the thing, some of the things they're talking about, mathematically and scientifically don't make sense,\" Stockman said, which you can see in the YouTube video below.Like a frustrated elementary school science teacher, Stewart grabbed a bowl of ice and a cup of water, and begrudgingly took it upon himself to demonstrate that ice does, in fact, cause water levels to rise.You're welcome, Congress.SYDNEY -- This is one way to make an arse out of the government.This image taken by Cranky Curlew Productions at a beach in Queensland gives a powerful bums-up salute to the Australian government over its climate change stance.The message from participants was clear: Prime Minister Tony Abbott, you've got your head in the sand.George Hirst from Cranky Curlew told Mashable is the even hoped to highlight the way our leaders are ignoring a planetary emergency.\"People around the world are realising this more and more every day and yet Australia, in particular, is going totally backwards on this.It's just plain embarrassing and it makes us angry that our government has become so controlled by big coal and carbon polluting businesses,\" Hirst said.\"We want to show them what we think of this stupidity so it's fitting that we 'salute' them with our butts in the air and our heads in the sand.\"The event organised by the North Queensland Conservation Council created the #HeadsinSandSalute photograph to pay tribute to the lack of action on climate change by the Australian government.At least 80 people were involved in the different approach on Townsville’s main beach The Strand on Sunday.\"Together we must and we will win this fight to protect our planet, overcome the arrogance and ignorance of our leaders, and leave for our children a world as beautiful as the one that we have been honoured to enjoy,\" the conservation council wrote on its website.Follow Townsville's lead and salute Oz Goverments' Climate Change achievements on Sunday #headsinsandsalute pic.twitter.com/wXMI5J2x5G— George Hirst

world leaders in one place at one time to focus on the issue.Mashable was on scene to provide live updates throughout the day.Below is our live coverage of how it all went down.The historic United Nations Climate Summit provided the clearest signals yet of how world leaders and top business executives perceive the threat of global warming.There was a dizzying barrage of announcements that together add up to proof of life for the previously moribund U.N. climate treaty talks.Here are the top takeaways from the summit:1.Extreme weather is spurring action.One thing the shock-and-awe blitz of world leaders' four-minute speeches had in common is that countries now recognize they are already feeling the sting of climate change, in the form of extreme weather.From more intense heat waves to larger wildfires, these climate events are providing a basis for action that was missing the last time leaders gathered to discuss climate change in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009.U.S. President Barack Obama spoke about the impacts of extreme weather as a major motivator for climate action, as did leaders from every other inhabited continent:In America, the past decade has been our hottest on record.Along our eastern coast, the city of Miami now floods at high tide.In our west, wildfire season now stretches most of the year.In our heartland, farms have been parched by the worst drought in generations, and drenched by the wettest spring in our history.A hurricane left parts of this great city dark and underwater.And some nations already live with far worse.In China, for example, extreme weather and climate events have been taking a huge toll on the economy, and complicated efforts to reduce poverty.At the summit, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli went a step further than China has ever gone before in announcing that the country's emissions of manmade greenhouse gases would peak \"as early as possible.\"In a press conference following Zhang's speech, Xie Zhenhua, vice-chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters that \"weather extremes have greatly affected the Chinese people.\"Xie said weather extremes have cost China more than 200 billion Renminbi per year.“The losses are extensive in china,\" Xie said, noting that climate impacts extend to \"water, land and people.\"These impacts, along with China's staggering air pollution problem, are forcing China to take action both on climate mitigation, which refers to preventing global warming, and adaptation, which means coping with its consequences.“We’re on the same page with those countries when it comes to the importance of adaptation,” Xie said.China is the world's top emitter of planet-warming carbon dioxide.2.We are awesome at opening and closing Climate Summit meetings.The in-between part still needs some work.The most powerful moment at the entire summit occurred during its opening ceremony.Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a 26-year-old poet from the low-lying Marshall Islands, a small nation in the western Pacific, read a poem that essentially shamed world leaders for not acting fast enough to prevent sea level rise.Recent studies show that global average sea level rise may exceed 3.3 feet by the end of this century, with higher amounts in some areas.Small island states from the Marshall Islands to Kiribati have been warning for years that they face extinction if global warming is not curbed, but the rise in greenhouse gas emissions hit a new high this year.An emotional plea at the beginning of a U.N. climate meeting is nothing new.Philippines delegate Yeb Sano pleaded with the world to \"stop this madness\" at the 2013 climate talks in Warsaw, shortly after his country was ravaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan.Previous meetings have seen similar outcries.Haiyan was one of the most intense typhoons on record, with maximum sustained winds of about 195 miles per hour, when it slammed into the city of Tacloban on Nov. 7, 2013.On Tuesday, the Climate Summit in New York closed with an original song by Natasha Bedingfield, which provided an emotional end to the meeting.3.So, about that Green Climate Fund...The Green Climate Fund was established at the 2009 Copenhagen Summit, and was considered to be a positive, tangible outcome at the otherwise deflating 2009 meeting.Industrialized nations, including the U.S., set a goal of providing $100 billion a year to developing countries through 2020 to ease their transition off fossil fuels, and combat climate change impacts.The fund is now raising money for its first three years of operation after 2015, but is nowhere near its goals.On Tuesday, a total of about $1.3 billion in new pledges were announced from Denmark, France, South Korea, Norway, Mexico and three smaller nations.The lack of a U.S. financial commitment on Tuesday was noteworthy, although the U.S. has long resisted developing countries' climate change-related financial assistance and technology transfer requests.“The pledges announced here still leave the fund with less than a sixth of the total developed countries should commit,” Tim Gore, head of climate policy for aid group Oxfam, said in a statement.\"All eyes are now on those yet to stump up, including the U.S., UK, Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, and on the devil in the detail of those pledges made today.\"4.Private companies and cities are in the lead now.Dozens of mayors were at the summit to discuss their efforts to cut emissions at the local level.A new study from the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group found that by 2050, cities could cut their annual emissions by an amount that would be equivalent to half of yearly global coal use.Right now, about 3.6 billion people live in cities worldwide, and this is projected to grow to more than 6 billion by mid-century.On the business front, in the runup to the summit, 73 countries and more than 1,000 businesses, including Norwegian oil company Statoil, signed a World Bank initiative to encourage governments to set a price on carbon.At the summit itself, 25 of those companies, including Unilever and Philips, committed to pricing carbon internally, and boosting their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Putting a price on carbon is important because it provides an economic incentive for activities with a lower carbon footprint.5.We might actually keep forests around for a bit longer.The summit featured the rollout of the New York Declaration on Forests, which governments, companies and nongovernmental organizations signed.The declaration proposes cutting the rate of natural forest loss by 50% by 2020, and eliminating it altogether by 2030, among other actions.Big palm-oil producers, such as Cargill, also committed to protecting Indonesia's remaining forests, much of which has been lost due to palm oil production.Indonesia has the worst deforestation rate in the world, having recently overtaken Brazil.A recent study found that the greatest forest losses occurred in 2012, the year after the Indonesian government issued a moratorium on new forest development projects.At the climate summit, the Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono touted that moratorium, without mentioning the data showing its ineffectivenessPreserving forests is a high priority for solving climate change since most forests are a carbon sink; this means they take in more carbon than they let out.BONUS: 6 Common Myths About Climate ChangeWhen it comes to climate change, it's easy to talk about it, listen to the latest predictions global doom, and worry, worry, worry.But what can we do besides recycle, reduce, and reuse to take action on climate change?Take to the streets, for one thing.In New York on Sunday, more than 310,000 people, joined by many thousands more around the world, marched to demand action on climate change by individuals, states, countries, and corporations.Here are a few things you can do to turn apathy into action.1.Take a good hard look at your carbon footprintInstead of just guessing what it takes to reduce your personal carbon emissions, know exactly what you and your household are responsible for, and what you can change.Everything from size of your home, the efficiency of your appliances, how much you drive or fly, what you eat, and how much you recycle can make a big difference in your personal carbon footprint.Online calculators at Nature.org and Conservation.org can get you started toward understanding what your carbon footprint looks like.2.Do these things now to limit your carbon emissions.Now that you have a handle on your personal carbon spew, figure out where you can reduce emissions.At home, change lights to energy-efficient bulbs, replace power-hungry appliances, insulate your home to reduce heating and air conditioning costs, consume food that doesn't require as much transportation, and eat less meat, which has a significantly higher carbon footprint than fruits and vegetables.At work, switch to public transportation, carpooling, or biking for your commute.3.Join an environmental group at the front linesMany groups are advocating for climate change.Here are a few to look

far-reaching policies that would reduce emissions and curb the rate of global warming.Recent studies forecast a global average sea level rise of more than 3.3 feet by the end of the century, and new research shows a record rise in greenhouse gas emissions.These statistics, along with extreme weather in recent years, have spurred world leaders into widespread recognition of climate change, along with an increasing desire to take action.The Summit was preceded by the People’s Climate March in Manhattan on Sunday September 20, which was attended by 300,000 people.In the next few years, big name brands such as Axe body spray, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap may be considered more environmentally friendly than they are now, thanks to actions taken at the United Nations Climate Summit earlier this week.Several major companies, including Kellogg's, McDonald's, L’Oréal and Nestlé were among those who signed an ambitious pledge to combat deforestation at the New York summit on Tuesday.Signed by more than 150 corporate, government, and civil-society groups, the New York Declaration on Forests outlines goals to cut natural forest loss in half by 2020, and eliminate it by 2030.Meeting these goals would cut between 4.5 billion and 8.8 billion tons of carbon pollution every year -- about as much as the total annual emissions for the U.S., according to the document.[seealso slug=\"united-nations-climate-summit-takeaways\"]The agreement marks a growing shift in efforts by corporations to promote sustainability efforts.Susanne Breitkopf, senior political advisor at Greenpeace, told Mashable that environmental issues are becoming more urgent for companies, as climate change begins to affect their bottom line.\"Deforestation has become a liability for companies in the marketplace,\" she said.\"We have certainly seen companies reform in past years.\"The Declaration on Forests also included specific commitments to ensure sustainable production of palm oil, a major contributor to deforestation.Palm oil is used in many kinds of products, from cereals and breads to shampoos and ice cream.In the past year, the top three palm-oil producers -- Wilmar International, Golden Agri-Resources, and Cargill -- have adopted zero deforestation policies, affecting about 60% of the global palm-oil trade.All in all, 24 leading global producers of palm oil and other commodities committed to the goal of zero net deforestation by 2020 as part of Tuesday's agreement.One of the biggest corporate partners to sign the declaration is Unilever, which sells products under more than 1,000 brand names worldwide, including Dove, Ben & Jerry's and Axe.Unilever is working to track down and ethically source all the palm oil in each of its products, which would be a first for such a large company.Company CEO Paul Polman said in a statement that the pledge \"signals a real intention to accelerate action.\"“The last few months have seen a welcome race to the top,\" he said.\"Consumers have sent companies a clear signal that they do not want their purchasing habits to drive deforestation, and companies are responding.\"However, conservation groups say the agreement does not go far enough, and that we shouldn't rely on corporate commitments alone.Greenpeace called for more extensive and immediate government action in a statement this week.\"The New York Declaration is missing ambitious targets and tangible actions,\" Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said.\"Halting the global loss of natural forests by 2030, and eliminating deforestation from agricultural commodities by 2020 at the latest would mean that years of continued forest clearance still lie ahead of us.\"Breitkopf, senior political adviser at Greenpeace, also said the commitment \"will not be sufficient,\" and that there is no time to spare when it comes to deforestation.\"The situation is really quite urgent,\" she said.\"As we all gathered in New York [for the U.N.Climate Summit], the Indonesian government had declared a disaster alert due to the forest fires that are still raging through the country.Deforestation is really becoming a health hazard.\"Indonesia has the highest rate of deforestation in the world, despite its president's pledge to halt new forest development starting in 2011.The main driver of deforestation in Indonesia is the lucrative palm-oil industry, and huge tracts of land are being felled and burned in order to make way for palm-oil plantations.Although Greenpeace welcomes the commitments that are being made, it is important to hold those involved with the declaration accountable, and ensure action is taken, Breitkopf said.\"It is good that governments and the private sector come together again and renew the momentum -- we are glad to see that,\" she said.\"But we have seen many declarations and conferences and meetings in the past, and what really matters now is the action that follows from it, and we will monitor that really closely.\"Climate change could affect the ratio of human males to human females that are born in some countries, a new study from Japan suggests.The researchers found that male fetuses may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.Since the 1970s, temperature fluctuations from the norm have become more common in Japan, and at the same time there has been an increase in the deaths of male fetuses relative to the number of deaths of female fetuses in that country, according to the study.Over this period, the ratio of male to female babies born in the country has been decreasing, meaning there have been fewer and fewer male babies born relative to the number of female babies born.This suggests that climate warming or climate extremes could negatively affect male fetuses, study researcher Dr. Misao Fukuda of M&K Health Institute in Ako, Japan, told Live Science in an email.In the study, the researchers looked at monthly temperature data gathered from 1968 to 2012 by the Japan Meteorological Agency and also at data on fetal deaths and infants born during that time from the Vital Statistics of Japan database.In recent years, there have been nearly 90,000 newborns and about 1,000 fetal deaths recorded monthly in Japan.The researchers considered fetal deaths to be those that were spontaneously aborted (or miscarried) after 12 weeks of pregnancy.The study also looked at two recent extreme weather events in Japan — a very hot summer in 2010 and a very cold winter in 2011.During the hot summer — which was the warmest in the country since 1898 — there was an increase in the number of fetal deaths in September of that year, and nine months later, there was a decrease in the ratio of male to female babies born in the country.A similar phenomenon occurred the next year — during a very cold winter in January 2011, there was an increase in fetal deaths, and nine months later, there was a decrease in the number of male babies born relative to female babies born in that country.These findings suggest that the \"recent temperature fluctuations in Japan seem to be linked to a lower male to female sex ratio of newborn infants, partly via increased male fetal deaths,\" the researchers wrote in the Sept. 14 issue of the journal Fertility and Sterility.However, the new study only found an association, and cannot prove that the climate changes were responsible for the change in sex ratio in Japan.Other factors, such as pollution and toxins in the environment, may affect sex ratios.But the researchers noted that the study found a link between temperatures in a specific month and the sex ratios nine months later, suggesting temperature fluctuations may play a role in recent declines in the country's sex ratio.Previous studies on the effects of temperature changes on sex ratios in human populations have been mixed.A 2008 study published in the journal PNAS found a link between cold temperatures and a decrease in the male-to-female ratio in Scandinavian countries between 1865 and 1914, but also found a link between warmer temperatures and an increase in the ratio.In addition, two previous studies in Finland and New Zealand did not find a link between those countries' yearly average temperature and sex ratios of newborns from the mid-1800s to the mid-2000s.However, the researchers in the new study noted that neither New Zealand nor Finland experience the same temperature extremes as Japan, where summers can be very hot and winters very cold.Japan has also experienced a greater increase in its average yearly temperature in recent years compared with New Zealand and Finland, the researchers said.\"It is of great interest to know whether any country observed a similarly lowered sex ratio of newborn infants\" during the recent extreme weather events, the researchers said.The reason why male babies may be more vulnerable to extreme temperatures is not known.But it has been reported previously that male embryos are affected negatively by stress factors such as earthquakes or toxic agents, Fukuda said.Some studies have also found that male births decline with increasing geographical latitude (i.e., colder climates) in Europe and Asia.The new findings warrant further investigation of how stress factors like climate change may affect the ratio of male to female infants born, the researchers said.A group of climate scientists has brought satellite imagery from the 1960s back from the dead, not only extending the record of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice by at least another decade compared to what researchers had previously known, but also providing new opportunities for studying the planet to a wide range of researchers.The restoration of imagery from the Nimbus satellite program, which ended in the 1970s, is an example of an experiment in obtaining access to so-called “dark data,” which refers to data that exists in some form, such as a ship’s logbook or old satellite data tapes, but is not currently accessible to present-day researchers.In this case, the 35-millimeter data tapes from the satellites were lost in the bowels of facilities at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The Nimbus data provides the earliest known view of Antarctica’s sea ice, which has made headlines recently for setting a record for the largest ice extent, and spotted large breaks in Arctic sea ice where none were thought to have occurred.The modern satellite record of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic starts in 1979, so the added data gives scientists a longer-term view that informs their understanding of present-day events.There are also photos of Hurricane Camille, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the U.S., which devastated the northeast Gulf Coast in 1969.In their quest to unlock the secrets of the planet’s climate system and better understand the consequences of manmade global warming, scientists are increasingly turning to dark data projects to provide new insight.David Gallaher, a researcher at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, said he and his colleagues had to overcome numerous obstacles, including technical and bureaucratic hurdles, to read data tapes from the Nimbus satellites.There were a total of seven Nimbus satellites launched between 1964 and 1978, and machines to read the 35-millimeter data reels hadn’t been made since the 1970s, Gallaher said.Once his team gained access to them and borrowed a machine capable of reading the tapes, they scanned all 250,000 images.However, there were still more challenges to overcome, such as figuring out what spot on Earth the pictures were showing, since the images lacked location data.Simply guessing the location wouldn't have worked, considering how disorienting some of the data was.Gallaher and his colleagues managed to find an old Air Force file of satellite navigation data that enabled them to create a cross-referencing system for undergraduate students to use when cataloging the images.The only records we have of Antarctic sea ice in the 1960sThe Nimbus satellites had visible light sensors that were considered state of the art for the time, as well as infrared light sensors.This data allows researchers to spot sea ice extent, among other things.The new record of Antarctic sea ice that has resulted is intriguing, Gallaher says.“We actually found the ice edges and it’s been kind of fascinating.”According to the recovered data, 1964 was largest sea ice year in the Antarctic, until 2014, that is.Yet just two years later, sea ice declined by 20%, to the smallest extent on record there.“There was wild variability going on,” Gallaher said.“The Arctic was colder, but in the Antarctic, strange things were going on,” he said.Scientists are still trying to determine why Antarctic sea ice has been growing in recent years even while the land-based ice has been melting at an increasing rate, adding to global sea level rise.The high variability in the 1960s, based on the Nimbus satellite data, suggests that scientists may not yet have a full understanding of what governs sea ice dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere.The Nimbus data is the only direct data of 1960s-era Antarctic sea ice that scientists have from that time period, Gallaher says.Sea ice extents in the Arctic were much larger in the 1960s than they are now, Gallaher said, which is consistent with the global warming-induced decline in Arctic sea ice.Still, even in years with higher volume’s of sea ice, the satellite spotted ice-free areas near the North Pole that were 200 to 300 miles across.“We found holes in ice at North Pole that we didn’t expect to find,” he said.“It’s a big hole,” said Garrett Campbell, who also works on the Nimbus project from the NSIDC.“We basically opened a window into the past… this data was truly dark.”The data recovered from the old satellites, which have long since burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere, extend beyond climate science and might include studying deforestation, sea surface temperatures, human development patterns such as highways and cities, and more.“We haven’t even scratched the surface of what people might be able to do with it,” Gallaher said.Another term for the dark data project, Gallaher says, is “techno-archeology.” He said there is talk of starting a foundation dedicated to funding such projects, because traditional sources of science research funding, such as the National Science Foundation, don’t have specific programs geared toward such activities.“This is not a terribly expensive process to get this stuff back, but it does take some money to do it,” he said.The entire project, which NASA funded, cost only $450,000, compared to the many millions it cost to put the satellites into orbit in the first place, Gallaher said.“It looks like a new satellite but it’s fifty years old.\"SYDNEY -- The Abbott government reached an agreement on Wednesday with the Palmer United Party and other crossbench senators that will see the implementation of its Direct Action climate policy.The government's flagship environmental policy is expected to cost $2.5 billion over the next four years.Under the scheme, polluters will be paid grants as an incentive to reduce carbon emissions.This policy will replace the carbon tax that the Abbot government abandoned in July.\"Two big things occur,\" Environment Minister Greg Hunt told the media in Canberra.\"One, we protect existing projects.Two, we provide opportunities for farmers and small businesses to improve their soil, to reduce emissions, for Australians to participate in energy efficiency on a grand scale.\"Palmer United Party Leader Clive Palmer had previously opposed the Direct Action plan, describing it as \"token gesture.\"His party instead had proposed an emissions trading scheme (ETS), which would be activated once Australia's major trading partners were deemed to be taking sufficient action on climate change.Clive Palmer continues his record of not sticking to anything #abc730— Janet M (@cinderella_oz) October 29, 2014The deal struck between Palmer and the government does not include such a scheme, but it does leave the door ajar.The agreement involves a commitment to fund an 18-month inquiry into the effectiveness of emission trading programs around the world.This is to be conducted by the Climate Change Authority, an agency set up by the previous Labor government that the Coalition Government had until today promised to abolish.It has instead committed to funding the authority while it undertakes the inquiry, which will seek to determine the feasibility of an Australian ETS and recommend emission reduction targets post-2020.Palmer emphasised the importance of leaving open the possibility of an ETS.\"I think from our perspective, once our trading partners all have an ETS, it's fundamental that Australia has one,\" he told reporters in Canberra.\"Because if we don't, we'll be saddled with a tariff effectively for the export of our products to those markets.\"Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, who has expressed his party's commitment to an ETS, questioned whether the arrangement was in Australia's best interests.\"Tony Abbott has once again sold his soul to Clive Palmer and Australia will pay the price,\" he said.\"This is a dirty deal that will send our country backwards.\"Greens Leader Christine Milne was also critical of the agreement.Palmer’s deal to help Abbott pass the sham that is Direct Action serves his self-interest at the expense of our environment, yet again— Christine Milne (@senatormilne) October 29, 2014The government requires six Senate votes to pass the legislation.Three of these will come courtesy of Palmer United Party senators Jacqui Lambie, Glenn Lazarus and Zhenya Wang, while Ricky Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party and independent senators John Madigan and Nick Xenophon have also pledged their support.Scientists say Australia has already been suffering from the consequences of global warming, with recent studies showing that the record hot summer of 2013 was almost certainly exacerbated by increasing average surface temperatures.Other research has shown that as global warming continues, Australia is likely to experience more intense bushfire seasons as well.However, contrary to this science, Prime Minister Tony Abbot has expressed doubts about the ties between global warming and extreme weather and climate events.From India to Texas, people are rapidly depleting their valuable stores of groundwater -- leading to the possibility that aquifers may be emptied within decades, a NASA researcher has warned.In a commentary published Wednesday in the journal Nature Climate Change, Jay Famiglietti, who has helped lead the use of a NASA satellite system to detect groundwater changes around the world, warned of dramatic consequences to come if changes are not made to the way that societies manage water supplies.Currently, Famiglietti told Mashable, management of global groundwater stores is inadequate to nonexistent, as governments focus on regulating surface water supplies while tapping underground aquifers as much as they want to.“Our overuse of groundwater puts our overall water security at far greater risk than we thought,” Famiglietti says.Unlike surface water, which is replenished through precipitation, groundwater can take centuries to recharge.Yet humans are depleting groundwater at rates that far exceed the pace at which this water can be replenished.Think of it this way: groundwater is analogous to a pension, a long-term investment that takes many years to pay off.If you withdraw more than you put in, you'll go bankrupt in the long run.Dams and reservoirs, meanwhile, are more like a checking account.\"Groundwater is being pumped at far greater rates than it can be naturally replenished, so that many of the largest aquifers on most continents are being mined, their precious contents never to be returned,\" Famiglietti, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, wrote.Famiglietti has used NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite system, which is capable of detecting the most subtle changes in Earth's gravitational field to spot land elevation changes, and thus water depletion, to publish a number of studies on groundwater in recent years.During the summer, for example, he contributed to a study that revealed that water users throughout the Colorado River Basin are tapping into groundwater supplies to make up for the lack of adequate supplies of surface water.The study found that more than 75% of the water loss in the Colorado River Basin since 2004 came from groundwater.GRACE showed that between December 2004 and November 2013, the Colorado River basin lost nearly 53 million acre feet of freshwater, which is double the total volume of the country’s largest reservoir -- Lake Mead in Arizona.More than three-quarters of the total — about 41 million acre feet — was from groundwater.Other GRACE data has shown that the Sacramento River and San Joaqin River basins have lost a total of 4 trillion gallons of groundwater per year, which has caused the land surface to sink.Groundwater, Famiglietti told Mashable, accounts for more than half of the irrigation water used to grow the world's food.Aquifers of particular concern to Famiglietti include the North China Plain, Australia's Canning Basin, the Northwest Sahara Aquifer System, the High Plains and Central aquifers in the U.S., and aquifers between northwestern India and the Middle East.\"Because the gap between supply and demand is routinely bridged with non-renewable groundwater, even more so during drought, groundwater supplies in some major aquifers \"will be depleted in a matter of decades,\" Famiglietti wrote.Famiglietti says that groundwater depletion in northwest India is at the top of his list of concerns, in part because of the population growth.Water shortages could lead to political instabilityAs climate change redistributes water around the planet, with wet areas getting potentially wetter and dry areas drier, it could further stress water supplies, Famiglietti said.This could lead to conflicts, particularly in countries that lack resiliency to such shocks.A key factor in groundwater depletion is that water laws do not do much to manage aquifers.In California, the ongoing drought has forced state leaders to pass a bill meant to track groundwater supplies and encourage their sustainable use -- but not before the state has actually sunk in elevation, because so much groundwater has been used for agriculture.The consequences of poorly managing groundwater supplies in the coming decades could be extremely disruptive, in the form of declining agricultural production, reductions in energy generation and the possibility of huge spikes in food prices.COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Climate change is happening, it's almost entirely man's fault and limiting its impacts may require reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero this century, the U.N.'s panel on climate science said Sunday.The fourth and final volume of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's giant climate assessment didn't offer any surprises, nor was it expected to, since it combined the findings of three earlier reports released in the past 13 months.But it underlined the scope of the climate challenge in stark terms.Emissions, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, may need to drop to zero by the end of this century for the world to have a decent chance of keeping the temperature rise below a level that many consider dangerous.Failure to do so, which could require deployment of technologies that suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, could lock the world on a trajectory with \"irreversible\" impacts on people and the environment, the report said.Some impacts are already being observed, including rising sea levels, a warmer and more acidic ocean, melting glaciers and Arctic sea ice and more frequent and intense heat waves.#UNSG on chances of #climate deal in Paris 2015 - \"I am confident we can do it.We can make it happen.\"#AR5— UN Spokesperson (@UN_Spokesperson) November 2, 2014\"Science has spoken.There is no ambiguity in their message.Leaders must act.Time is not on our side,\" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the report's launch in Copenhagen.The full report is here.(PDF)Amid its grim projections, the report also offered hope.The tools needed to set the world on a low-emissions path are there; it just has to break its addiction to the oil, coal and gas that power the global energy system while polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping CO2, the chief greenhouse gas.\"We have the means to limit climate change,\" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said.\"The solutions are many and allow for continued economic and human development.All we need is the will to change, which we trust will be motivated by knowledge and an understanding of the science of climate change.\"Breaking news: climate change is real, we cause it and are not doing enough to stop it #IPCC http://t.co/FcLfexprqD pic.twitter.com/0LqxWf1Q8B— Greens in the EP (@GreensEP) November 2, 2014The IPCC was set up in 1988 to assess global warming and its impacts.The report released Sunday caps its latest assessment, a mega-review of 30,000 climate change studies that establishes with 95-percent certainty that nearly all warming seen since the 1950s is man-made.Today only a small minority of scientists challenge the mainstream conclusion that climate change is linked to human activity.Sleep-deprived delegates approved the final documents Saturday afternoon after a weeklong line-by-line review in Copenhagen that underscored that the IPCC process is not just about science.The reports must be approved both by scientists and governments, which means political issues from U.N. climate negotiations, which are nearing a 2015 deadline for a global agreement, inevitably affect the outcome.The rift between developed and developing countries in the U.N. talks opened up in Copenhagen over a box of text that discussed what levels of warming could be considered dangerous.After a protracted battle, the delegates couldn't agree on the wording, and the box was dropped from a key summary for policy-makers to the disappointment of some scientists.\"If the governments are going to expect the IPCC to do their job,\" said Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer, a lead author of the IPCC's second report, they shouldn't \"get caught up in fights that have nothing to do with the IPCC.\"The omission of the box meant the word \"dangerous\" disappeared from the summary altogether.It appeared only twice in a longer underlying report compared to seven times in a draft produced before the Copenhagen session.But the less loaded word \"risk\" was mentioned 65 times in the final 40-page summary.\"Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts,\" the report said.World governments in 2009 set a goal of keeping the temperature rise below 2 degrees C (3.6 F) compared to before the industrial revolution.Temperatures have gone up about 0.8 C (1.4 F) since the 19th century.Meanwhile, emissions have risen so fast in recent years that the world has already used up two-thirds of its carbon budget, the maximum amount of CO2 that can be emitted to have a likely chance of avoiding 2 degrees of warming, the IPCC report said.\"This report makes it clear that if you are serious about the 2-degree goal ... there is nowhere to hide,\" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.\"You can't wait several decades to address this issue.\"Pointing to the solution, the IPCC said the costs associated with mitigation action such as shifting the energy system to solar and wind power and other renewable sources and improving energy efficiency would reduce economic growth only by 0.06 percent annually.And Pachauri said that cost should be measured against the implications of doing nothing, putting \"all species that live on this planet\" at peril.The report is meant as a scientific roadmap for the U.N. climate negotiations, which continue next month in Lima, Peru.That's the last major conference before a summit in Paris next year, where a global agreement on climate action is supposed to be adopted.In the wake of Tuesday's elections, there appears to be two ways of thinking about the repercussions for climate policy.One school of thought holds that this is essentially doomsday, with U.S. President Barack Obama's administration facing the potential gutting of its environmental programs -- including the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon emissions regulations -- by a Republican-dominated Congress.The other view holds that this election was not in any way a referendum on how voters view climate change.In fact, the race revealed indications that it is increasingly untenable to be a candidate for major office while holding the view that manmade climate change does not exist.I think the second view is closer to reality, and here are five reasons why:1.Big Green forced some Republican candidates to tack left on climate.The Colorado Senate race is an excellent example of a race where big environmental donors, including billionaire Tom Steyer's NextGen Climate Action super PAC, spent big on holding on to Democratic Sen. Mark Udall's seat.Udall has a solid voting record in favor of clean energy, and has long spoken out about the dangers of global warming.But Republican Cory Gardner blurred the differences between him and Udall by advertising his support for natural gas and wind power.This move was one of many made by Gardner that showed his adroitness as a candidate, and it wouldn't have been necessary if it were not for the spending by Green groups.So, even though Steyer's organization spent big for Udall (to the tune of at least $7.4 million) and lost, there is a silver lining in that Gardner is now on the record as holding less extreme energy views than when he entered the race as a House member.In other races, Republican candidates were forced to resort to the ridiculous \"I'm not a scientist\" line when asked about their views on global warming.A few years ago, most candidates simply were not asked about their views on this subject.So that's slight progress right there.2.The polarized midterm electorate is not the same as the 2016 electorate.This was not a climate change election.Races from Colorado to Georgia were dominated by Obama's sinking popularity and a sense that the country was on the wrong track domestically and abroad, plus an electoral map and midterm electorate that favored Republican candidates.Viewed this way, the climate change implications of the Republicans' success are fuzzier.Polls showed that while Democratic voters were overwhelmingly likely to count climate change as a serious issue, very few Republican voters on Tuesday felt the same way.Some used that exit poll data to argue that the partisan divide on climate change is deepening, not softening.However, the midterm electorate is smaller, older and whiter than the general election electorate that will likely turn out in 2016, so treat such polls with caution.When 400,000 of us took the streets of NYC on September 21, we showed that a new sort of climate politics is possible.— 350 dot org (@350) November 5, 2014Another indication that this does not reflect the broader public's views is that numerous national polls have shown that a majority of the public supports actions to reduce the severity of climate change, especially younger voters.Those voters showed their strength at the People's Climate March in New York in September, signaling the rise of a new, more formidable climate movement.Jamie Henn, a spokesperson for 350.org, which helped organize the march, told InsideClimateNews on Wednesday that activists need to do more work to foster a grassroots movement.\"We've always said we need to find another currency to drive change than campaign contributions.We've learned we to need to strengthen the grassroots movement.We are not going to win climate through a series of ad buys,\" Henn said.3.One of the most ardent supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline lost.Nebraska Republican Rep. Lee Terry lost his bid for reelection in a race that climate activists tried to turn into a referendum on the Keystone XL pipeline.Terry has been a major supporter of the project, which would carry oil from the oil sands in Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.The planned pipeline route goes through Nebraska, which has energized a grassroots movement against it due to safety and environmental concerns.So, while a Republican Senate will likely be far more supportive of Keystone overall, Terry's election offers a warning shot not to overreach on the issue.Then again, Terry had other issues weighing him down, including controversial comments he made about keeping a congressional pay raise.Interestingly, the recent crash in oil prices may make the pipeline a less attractive investment for TransCanada, which is the company seeking to build it.So, despite the election of many senators who have said they would vote to permit Keystone, the need for it may not be as great anymore, anyway.4.Most climate policy progress in the next two years will come from international deals and executive action.International climate negotiations will take much of the spotlight away from domestic climate policy in the next two years, with the world facing a 2015 deadline for crafting a new climate treaty.The U.S. has shown some success in working out bilateral cooperation agreements with other major emitters, most notably China, and Obama will continue to be free to use his executive authority to pursue such arrangements, going forward.As for a United Nations treaty, it's not like the old Senate was poised to pass a climate treaty anyway.Obama's administration was already planning to craft a treaty that will avoid Senate ratification, so Tuesday's results didn't affect the likelihood of a global climate deal next year.5.The administration can still press forward with executive actions, albeit with more of a backlash.Although it will face a more recalcitrant Congress that will try to force the White House to accept cuts to climate programs, there is no need for Obama to swerve away from his stated intention of enacting climate policies through executive action rather than legislatively.Before Tuesday, the Senate could not pass a climate bill, nor will they be able to afterward.As for federal climate action the next two years, it’ll be nothing but defending EPA carbon regs from unceasing attack.— David Roberts (@drgrist) November 5, 2014What Senate Republicans will be able to do is try to slow down the EPA's landmark greenhouse gas emissions reductions, potentially delaying the implementation of the rules.They will also be able to cut funding for climate research and climate-change adaptation programs.However, if items are zeroed out, that may prompt a presidential veto.Two major caveats: governors and the ticking clock.The results at the state level are, in fact, a significant setback for climate advocates, considering how many climate policies have been enacted at the state level in the past several years.California, for example, has its own cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions, and many states have enacted renewable portfolio standards that mandate a certain amount of electricity must come from renewable sources, such as wind and solar power.New Republican administrations in Massachusetts and Maryland, for example, could mean different policies on renewable energy and climate adaptation in those states after years of Democratic control.However, in Massachusetts, the incoming governor has signaled support for continuing a regional, market-based approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In Florida, local officials will have to continue to try to hold the impacts from rising sea levels at bay, while working with a governor who doesn't think the science on manmade climate change is sufficiently convincing yet.And the reelection of numerous climate contrarians, such as Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walker, to state capitals means a continuation of existing backwards climate policies in many places.In addition to governorships, the other reason for pessimism -- or at the very least, impatience -- on climate policy is the increasingly stark scientific evidence showing that the window for acting to prevent dangerous climate change is closing fast.The most recent delivery of this message came on Sunday, by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.As the science shows, we simply can't afford to lose two years to obstruction, or worse -- regression.Next Tuesday may be Veteran's Day, but Dr. Doug Stein in Florida is setting aside Friday for a worldwide celebration of a different sort of sacrifice.\"Let's honor the men who have chosen to take responsibility and let them set a standard for those who have not done so.Let's honor the men who have done what's right ... for their families and their partners and the planet,\" Stein said.Stein's heroes?Men who get vasectomies.Stein, a Tampa-based vasectomist, is a co-founder of World Vasectomy Day, which celebrates its second year Friday with a planned 1,500 surgeries across 30 countries.Stein himself will perform 28 vasectomies at Planned Parenthood's Kissimmee Health Center, broadcast live via webcast (the webcast, organizers said, will be far enough away so no censorship is required).The event may sound like an elaborate promotion for Stein's practice, but it also comes with a not-so-subtle climate-change message: Academics have long connected the rising population with environmental harm (more people consuming fewer resources while producing more emissions), but the solutions can be seen as too touchy to get play on the policy level.A 2008 study from Oregon State University estimated that each child born in the United States adds 9,441 metric tons to each parent's carbon footprint, or 28 times the savings of a lifetime of recycling.Reducing unplanned pregnancies, the extension goes, would avert those emissions while also lessening the financial and health impact of the parents.Even when voluntary family planning enters the policy discussion, the discussion frequently focuses on potential mothers, both when discussing the health benefits of reducing unplanned pregnancies and when considering solutions such as sex education and contraception distribution.But advocates say it's time for men to play a role, and vasectomies — where the vas deferens is shut to block the movement of sperm — are seen as the most effective strategy.\"If you look at the population movement historically, there are some egregious policies, like China's one-child policy or some coercive policies in India [including forced sterilization],\" said Taralynn Reynolds, population and sustainability organizer for the Center for Biological Diversity.\"We're talking about anything but.We want to bring men in, having them bear some of the responsibility as well.\"CBD, the wildlife-focused green group, is getting in on the event, promoting it with a series of cartoons with slogans like \"Wildlife give thanks, cause I'm shooting blanks\" (CBD's population program has also made headlines for distributing condoms branded with endangered species and lines like \"Don't go bare, panthers are rare,\" or \"Safe intercourse saves the dwarf seahorse.\")Stein said that lessening the population's impact on the planet was in fact the reason he moved from his general urology practice to specializing in vasectomies.\"There are enough people out there dealing with kidney stones and general urology, and not enough who want to make vasectomies easy to get,\" Stein said.\"There's no stopping me in my desire to make people more aware, whether it's putting up billboards or doing vasectomies overseas.\"And World Vasectomy Day is a big part of his outreach message (he also boasts of raising a dozen billboards in the Tampa area).He founded the event last year with filmmaker Jonathan Stack to show how easy and painless getting snipped can be, highlighted by a \"vasectomy-athon\" at Australia's Royal Institution in Adelaide.This year he'll do the same thing with 28 surgeries, which Stein said is not an unusual number for one day (his appointments generally last 15 minutes with patient chit-chat).Some 250 doctors are expected to participate across the globe.Whether it can inject vasectomies or other family-planning measures into grand-scale climate discussions remains to be seen, since the optics of talking about population control have generally kept it on the back burner.But organizers are hoping that they can at least change the conversation around vasectomies and make the surgery more appealing.Paul Scott, co-founder of Plug In America, is flying to participate in the Florida events and tell the story of how, at age 22, he elected to get a vasectomy after reading The Population Bomb, the 1968 book warning of mass starvation and upheaval due to overpopulation.The U.S. and China jointly announced new emissions reduction targets on Wednesday (Tuesday night in the U.S.), including a first-ever commitment from China to see its emissions peak by 2030.The targets have been widely hailed as a game-changer for global climate talks, which have made little tangible progress in limiting global warming emissions since they began more than 30 years ago.However, the Senate's leading climate change contrarian, Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.), who has labeled global warming a \"massive hoax,\" came out firing on all cylinders against the agreement in a statement on Wednesday.Inhofe is set to take over the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee when the new Republicans take over the Senate in January.This committee is a key player in regulating the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and trying to reign it in.As part of the joint announcement from President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the U.S. committed to reducing its emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2025, relative to 2005.This represents a doubling in the speed of already announced emissions cuts by 2020.China committed to a peak in its greenhouse gas emissions, which have been growing along with the nation's economy, by the year 2030, and it also agreed to increase the share of renewable energy it uses to 20% of the total by the same year.Inhofe called China's commitment \"a non-binding charade.\"\"The American people spoke against the President's climate policies in this last election,\" he said in a statement.\"They want affordable energy and more economic opportunity, both which are being diminished by overbearing EPA mandates.As we enter a new Congress, I will do everything in my power to reign in and shed light on the EPA's unchecked regulations.\"The Obama administration is relying largely on EPA regulations, which do not require congressional approval, to achieve its emissions reduction goals.\"It's hollow and not believable for China to claim it will shift 20% of its energy to non-fossil fuels by 2030, and a promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world's largest economy to buy time,\" Inhofe said.\"China builds a coal-fired power plant every 10 days, is the largest importer of coal in the world, and has no known reserves of natural gas.\"According to the Energy Information Administration, China does have reserves of natural gas, just not nearly as much as the U.S.Until the joint announcement, China had committed to peaking its emissions at some point in the future, without specifying a date.It also had not set such an ambitious renewable energy target.Since the U.S. and China together account for about 40% of the world's carbon emissions, cooperation between the two could greatly enhance the likelihood of a climate agreement during global negotiations that are set to culminate in 2015.There's a paradox that becomes clear when analyzing the significance of the U.S. and Chinese global warming emissions commitments announced on Wednesday in Beijing.On the one hand, the announcements by President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are a potential political game changer that could pave the way toward a new, meaningful climate treaty by the end of 2015.To have the top two emitters in the world -- China is number one, the U.S. number two -- cooperating on climate change and presenting a united front to the world is something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.The history of the U.N. climate talks is replete with examples of disagreements between the U.S. and China over whether large developing countries should take on their own emissions commitments.Like a climate policy exorcism, the bilateral deal removes the specter of these disagreements stalling yet another agreement.Yet at the same time, there is ample justification for skepticism.After all, the actual emissions reduction goals that were announced are non-binding, and don't represent cuts anywhere on the scale that is needed to meet the globally agreed upon goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.Instead, they represent the most the U.S. can do with a President constrained by a recalcitrant Congress, and the most an ascendant China is willing to do without jeopardizing its economic growth, while addressing a lethal air pollution problem.It is against this backdrop that the U.S., China and other world leaders face a 2015 deadline for signing a new global climate agreement that would go into effect after 2020.Here's what the two countries agreed to do:China agreed to peak its emissions by 2030 at the latest, and increase the share of renewable energy it uses to 20% by 2020.China acknowledged that it would \"make [its] best efforts to peak early,\" which is a provision the U.S. encouraged China to include in the bilateral agreement, according to one White House official involved in the negotiations.The U.S., for its part, agreed to double the pace of its carbon emissions cuts, from 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2025.To accomplish these goals, the U.S. will have to increase the pace of its carbon emissions cuts from about 1.2% per year to at least 2.4% per year after 2020, White House science advisor John Holdren told Mashable in an interview.That pace is consistent with the rate of emissions reductions implied by the E.U.'s target of cutting emissions by 40% by 2030.New EPA, Energy Department rules may be requiredTo get there, the U.S. will have to rely exclusively on its executive powers, including current and, yes, new EPA and Energy Department rule-making.Such a strategy is necessary due to the refusal of many congressional Republicans to acknowledge mainstream climate science findings, and their opposition to most policies that would combat the problem.Over the next several months, the Obama administration is expected to announce a slew of other emissions measures, including rules to limit the emissions of methane, which is also a global warming gas, from natural gas facilities.Any new federal climate rules are sure to be controversial on Capitol Hill.Incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reacted to the U.S-China announcements by restating his commitment to reigning in the EPA.\"Easing the burden already created by EPA regulations will be a priority for me in the new Congress,\" McConnell said.On Wednesday, McConnell blasted the proposal as a free ride for China.“The agreement requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon regulations are happening in my state and other states around the country,\" he said.Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the likely chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, also criticized China's commitment by saying, \"It's hollow and not believable for China to claim it will shift 20% of its energy to non-fossil fuels by 2030, and a promise to peak its carbon emissions only allows the world's largest economy to buy time.\"China's goal involves a slowdown, and cessation, in its rate of emissions growth, which will require major investments in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency.Absolute emissions cuts at this point in China's development, which is what Republicans like Inhofe are implying is preferable, would necessitate a near-Herculean effort, considering the state of the country's economy.If Republicans succeed in significantly weakening the proposed EPA power plant rules, which would limit the emissions from existing power plants nationwide, the U.S. targets would be imperiled, Holdren said.\"We need the EPA power plant rules.If we were to lose those it would not be possible to meet this target,” he said.The U.S. and China can't solve this problem aloneHoldren and others involved in the negotiations pushed back against the contention that the Chinese commitment in particular represents a business as usual course of action.“On the Chinese side, it is going to require a very heavy lift on their part,\" Holdren said.\"They’re going to have to deploy an enormous amount of non-fossil fuel in the next 15 years.” According to Holdren, to meet these commitments, China will have to deploy as much non-fossil-fuel-generating capacity as the total generating capacity that the U.S. has in place today.In addition, China's commitment will likely require structural economic reforms, in addition to major investments in non-fossil fuel energy, White House officials said.China invested a total of $54 billion in renewables last year, which was more than the $36.7 billion investment by the U.S.“They’re committed to doing that, but to say this is business as usual is just not correct,\" he said.\"It’s extraordinarily significant that they’ve committed to do that.”When analyzing these commitments, it's important to separate out the political context from the carbon counting view.While the bilateral agreement, which was the culmination of nine months of behind the scenes talks, may pierce the long-stagnant bubble that is the U.N. climate talks, they're not a game changer from a carbon counting perspective, unless other countries join in with their own ambitious targets.So far, the world's top three emitters, together representing about half of global emissions, have announced post-2020 climate targets: the U.S., China and the European Union.At a press conference with Mr. Xi on Wednesday, President Obama said part of the goal in announcing new climate steps was to spur other nations, such as India and Brazil, to announce their own commitments.\"By making this announcement today, together, we hope to encourage all major economies to be ambitious — all countries, developing and developed — to work across some of the old divides so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement next year,\" Obama said.Even with these commitments, we're still on the way to blow way past the 2-degree targetRight now, in the absence of more ambitious emissions reduction targets, scientists have said we're on course to see an increase in global average temperatures of between 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit to 14 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.Studies have shown that warming on that scale would compromise the stability of the Greenland ice sheet, destabilize parts of Antarctica, cause sweeping changes in ecosystems and raise the risk of deadly heat waves and other extreme weather events, among other impacts.As scientists put it in a recent report: \"The consequences of such a temperature rise would be catastrophic.\"EU28, US, and Chinese targets on one figure.Are they really much different to Business as Usual?#climate #unfccc pic.twitter.com/qdonZPSdqP— Glen Peters (@Peters_Glen) November 12, 2014Scientists have calculated that we only have about 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit before we eclipse the 2-degree target.At current rates, we'll exhaust that budget in 30 years or less.In light of this, Glen Peters, a senior fellow at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway, says neither the U.S. or Chinese goals are on the scale needed to put the world on a pathway toward what is known as \"deep decarbonization.\"In an interview with Mashable, Peters pointed to several recent studies showing that China's emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases are increasing more slowly than they used to, and are already on course to peak around 2030.However, other studies, including a report released Wednesday by the International Energy Agency in Vienna, show that China may see its emissions peak after 2030 on a business as usual course, and given the size of its emissions footprint, shaving off a few years of emissions growth could be significant.Without China and other developing countries making significant cuts to their emissions, Peters says, there is no way to meet the 2 degree Celsius goal.“It’s very different to what China is suggesting.”He said the 2030 peak date is \"vague\" and could mean that \"emissions still grow quite substantially\" between now and then.The precise timing of when China's emissions reach their peak is extremely important, considering the sheer size of the country's emissions.In 2013 it constituted 28% of the world's emissions, according to the Global Carbon Project.Even a five-year difference in the peak year could mean several gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left in the ground, a White House official said.An analysis released Wednesday evening found that, if fully implemented by both countries, the U.S.-China climate pledges could prevent 639 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere.This would be a greater total than all global emissions from burning fossil fuels between 1990 and 2013, according to Climate Interactive, a nonpartisan group that evaluates climate scenarios.The first signs of whether the U.S-China announcements have helped break the climate negotiations logjam may come as early as next month, when the next round of U.N. climate talks begin in Lima, Peru.BONUS: 6 Common Myths About Climate ChangeIn a surprise breakthrough on Wednesday, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled new targets for cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.At a joint news conference in Beijing, the two leaders laid out their respective commitments, which were broader than expected.Obama said the new U.S. goal is to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025, compared to 2005 levels.The U.S. is on course to most likely meet Obama's previous commitment from 2009, which is to reduce emissions by 17% compared to 2005 levels by 2020.The new goal therefore commits the U.S. to a much faster pace of emissions cuts than previously announced, and, if fulfilled, would keep the country on course to cut emissions by 80% relative to 2005 levels by 2050.For China's part, Xi announced a target to have his country's greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2030 at the latest.China also announced a goal to increase the share of renewable energy it uses to about 20% by 2030.\"This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship,\" Obama said at the joint press conference in Beijing.\"This is an ambitious goal, but it is an achievable goal.\"FACT: President Obama just set a new target to cut U.S. carbon pollution by 26-28% by 2025.#ActOnClimate pic.twitter.com/HU2ODbxsXS— The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 12, 2014While China is not announcing absolute cuts to its emissions, the 2030 goal is a step further from what the country announced at the U.N.Climate Summit in New York in September.At that point, China's vice premier told world leaders that China would for the first time seek to stop its emissions growth at some point, without specifying a year.China's emissions have continued to rise as it builds new coal-fired power plants to meet its increasing demand for electricity, but the country has been plagued by noxious air pollution, which has increased pressure on the government to improve air quality.China is the top global emitter of greenhouse gases, with the U.S. following close behind.However, the U.S. leads when it comes to historical responsibility for global warming, since most of the emissions to date have come from the U.S. and other industrialized nations.Together, the U.S. and China account for about 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions.As the top two emitters in the world, the U.S. and China are the main players in these talks, and any announcements by them will be closely watched.The breakthrough announced in Beijing undercuts efforts among some developing countries to continue to hold out on making emissions commitments of their own, seeking instead for more ambitious targets and monetary incentives from industrialized nations.The next round of U.N. climate talks are scheduled to begin in Lima, Peru in less than three weeks.This conference will lay the groundwork for a meeting in Paris in December of next year, at which a new global climate agreement is due to be signed.The world is facing a deadline of 2015 in order to finalize a new agreement to cover the period beyond 2020, when the current Kyoto Protocol expires.Obama and Xi meet the press in Beijing.pic.twitter.com/7O2Rnz1Gwe— David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 12, 2014Obama said the agreement is aimed in part at spurring more action by other nations to secure an ambitious climate agreement.\"In addition, by making this announcement today, together, we hope to encourage all major economies to be ambitious -- all countries, developing and developed -- to work across some of the old divides so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement next year,\" Obama said.The exact form of a post-2020 agreement is unclear, as Republican opposition in Congress means that the Obama administration could not submit a binding treaty for Senate approval.Instead, the U.S.-China climate agreement references a \"a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force\" under a 1992 U.N. climate treaty, that is applicable to all countries.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has made climate change a top priority, hailed the announcements, saying they increase the odds that a successful treaty will be negotiated by 2015, according to a statement from his spokesman.\"Today, China and the United States have demonstrated the leadership that the world expects of them,\" the statement reads.\"This leadership demonstrated by the Governments of the world’s two largest economies will give the international community an unprecedented chance to succeed at reaching a meaningful, universal agreement in 2015.\"The agreement is being called a major breakthrough by the environmental community and by policymakers who have long been working on this issue.\"This is, in my view, the most important bilateral climate announcement ever,\" David Sandalow, formerly a top environmental official at the White House and the Energy Department, told the Associated Press.\"It sends the signal the two largest emitters in the world are working together to address this problem.\"\"The United States and China have just turned the international climate change negotiation on its head,\" said Neena Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington, in a statement.\"With this announcement, President Obama and President Xi have demonstrated historic leadership and shown the rest of the world that developed and developing countries can work together to address the threat of climate change.\"Recent scientific reports have made clear -- as little as a decade -- to begin to make significant cuts in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid dangerous impacts such as drastic amounts of sea level rise, increased species extinction rates, more severe extreme weather events and other costly consequences.In fact, scientists recommended that countries reach negative emissions, with the forests and oceans taking in more carbon than humans emit by burning fossil fuels, by the year 2100.Obama said the announced steps put the U.S. and China \"on a path to achieving the deep emissions reductions by advanced economies that the scientific community says is necessary to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change.\"Environmental leaders and climate activists greeted the news with optimism, expressing hope that the goals could be strengthened further.“These landmark commitments to curtail carbon pollution are a necessary, critical step forward in the global fight against climate change,\" said Frances Beineke, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.\"We look forward to working with both governments to strengthen their efforts -- because we are confident that both can achieve even greater reductions.”Former vice president and climate activist Al Gore said in a statement that this agreement marks the start of \"a new chapter\" in global climate talks.\"President Xi Jinping’s announcement that Chinese emissions will peak around 2030 is a signal of groundbreaking progress from the world’s largest polluter,\" Gore said.Congressional opponents of U.S. emissions cuts have long pointed to China's lack of emissions commitments as a reason for holding off on taking potentially costly actions at home.This development may help reduce the effectiveness of that argument.BOXER: \"Now there is no longer an excuse for Congress to block action on climate change.\"— Niels Lesniewski (@nielslesniewski) November 12, 2014In the wake of the Republican electoral gains in the midterm elections, though, it may be a struggle for the Obama administration to stay on track for meeting current climate commitments, let alone more ambitious ones.Republicans have vowed to weaken landmark U.S. EPA regulations announced in June that would reduce emissions from existing coal-fired power plants nationwide, and it is clear that President Obama intends to pursue additional climate actions via executive order, rather than through legislation.In a statement released to the press, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky criticized the new climate plans as part of a White House-led \"ideological war on coal.\"\"Easing the burden already created by EPA regulations will be a priority for me in the new Congress,\" McConnell said.In its second major international climate policy announcement of the week, the Obama administration is expected to declare as early as Friday that it intends to provide $3 billion over the course of four years to help developing countries adapt to global warming impacts and transition to renewable energy technologies.President Obama is expected to make the announcement at the start of the G20 meeting in Brisbane, Australia, raising the pressure on other G20 leaders to follow through with their own pledges.The announcement, which was first reported by The Guardian, particularly shines a spotlight on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has said his nation will not pay into the fund -- and who has played a role in keeping climate change off the list of priorities of the G20 summit.Abbott’s government also dismantled a carbon tax program and is viewed as being skeptical on mainstream climate science findings.The money, which would be paid into a U.N. fund known as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), would be subject to congressional approval, which could be complicated due to the incoming Republican majorities’ resistance to both foreign aid programs and climate policy.The fund was created in 2010 as a way for industrialized nations to help developing countries boost their climate resilience and reduce their use of fossil fuels, such as coal, which contribute to global warming.Global warming will hit developing countries, which have the least historical responsibility for causing global warming, the hardest.Adapting to sea level rise and other impacts will require billions in investments each year, according to multiple scientific assessments.The announcement is aimed at boosting the prospects for a global climate agreement by the end of 2015, which is an international deadline for crafting a new treaty that would go into effect in 2020.The next round of U.N. climate negotiations begin in Lima, Peru, in less than three weeks, and a GCF commitment ahead of these talks may increase the chances for success, because without it, developing countries were less likely to commit to take on emissions reduction commitments of their own.In addition, a meeting specifically focused on GCF pledges is scheduled for Nov. 19 and 20 in Berlin, during which other industrialized countries are expected to make their own contributions public.“It helps towards getting an international agreement done in 2015 which this administration cares deeply about,” Heather Coleman, climate change manager for Oxfam, told Mashable.\"I think developing countries are going to be very happy with this money and with this pledge.”On the heels of the U.S.-China emissions dealAlso boosting the odds of less contentious negotiations is the landmark agreement between the U.S. and China, which was announced on Wednesday.The U.S. agreed to reduce its emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2025, while China committed to peaking its emissions by 2030 at the latest, and raising its share of electricity generated by renewable energy technologies -- such as solar and hydropower -- to 20%.“This week has breathed new life into global climate action.Building on the landmark US-China climate agreement, this pledge signifies that the US is serious about delivering a global climate agreement,” said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington research group, in a statement.“These funds provide critical support to vulnerable communities that are unable to withstand the impacts of climate change on their own.Further, these funds can be used to support US companies looking to expand low-carbon opportunities overseas.”The $3 billion figure, if approved, would be the largest pledge from any country to date, reflecting the fact that the U.S. has the greatest historical responsibility for global warming, having emitted the most global warming pollution, such as carbon dioxide, since the start of the industrial revolution.(China emits the most now, but the U.S. has greatest historical carbon footprint.)The ultimate annual funding goal for the GCF is $100 billion, but nations are working toward an initial capitalization of $10 to $15 billion to start with.With the U.S. contribution, the GCF would still fall short of that goal, with a total of about $6 billion in pledges.However, other industrialized countries, such as the UK, have not yet made their pledges known.“I think it signifies that this administration wants to do the right thing on this issue,” Coleman said.“I think he is thinking… Listen, I am going to show my commitment to this issue,\" she added, regarding Obama’s approach to climate change issues.“He has nothing to lose anymore.”In remarks at a town hall meeting at Yangon University in Rangoon, Burma on Friday, Obama said the world is currently on a path to experience “catastrophic impacts around the world\" from global warming.“We're seeing the impacts in developed countries.We see it in my own country.And we're seeing impacts in poor countries.And we're seeing impacts, obviously, in island nations where if the temperatures continue to rise, we'll end up with oceans that are two feet or three feet higher, and it could swallow up entire countries,” Obama said.The $3 billion comes in addition to $2 billion that the U.S. committed during the George W. Bush administration to a World Bank climate investment fund.According to Oxfam, the $3 billion figure is “roughly equivalent” to the percentage of funds the U.S. provides to the Global Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.Getting the funds through Congress will be an uphill battle, but climate advocates on Capitol Hill will seek to push this through.“My feeling about that is any climate-related financing has a bullseye on it in this Congress,” Coleman said.“You have a group of Democrats who I think will step up.”On Nov. 7, four U.S. senators, all Democrats, wrote a letter to President Obama advocating for a “substantial pledge” to the GCF.“A substantial pledge to the GCF is necessary to assist developing nations in adapting to climate change and reducing their emissions, and may well be a necessary prerequisite for any future international agreement on climate change,” the letter read.The environmental group Friends of the Earth said the $3 billion pledge was far short of what's necessary.\"Given the partisan make-up of Congress, $3 billion is a reasonable figure,” said Karen Orenstein, a senior international policy analyst with the group, in a statement.“But if we step outside of Washington’s warped politics, then $3 billion falls magnitudes below what is actually needed by developing countries to confront a climate crisis that is not of their making.”So far, The GCF has already accrued close to $3 billion in developed country contributions, following $1 billion pledges each from Germany and France, along with eight other countries.On Thursday, the Kyodo News Agency reported that Japan will also announce its $1.5 billion contribution during the G-20 meeting.Developing countries are also contributing to the fund, including Mexico and Indonesia.Coleman said it is likely that Peru and other South American countries will also make their own contributions, even though they are under no obligation to do so.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott may have thought he left global climate change off the agenda for the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, but U.S. President Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have put it squarely in the spotlight through a series of actions in the past few days.Abbott, who has been skeptical about mainstream climate science findings and dismantled the industrialized world's first national carbon tax, had said he wanted the G20 meeting to focus on economic and security issues.Climate change has been a traditional agenda item for G20, G8 and G7 meetings in recent years, making its absence from the Brisbane gathering of world leaders noteworthy.Obama ensured climate change was front and center before he even landed in Queensland's capital city on Friday.On Wednesday in Beijing, he announced landmark joint emissions commitments with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The U.S. agreed to reduce its emissions from 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, which represents a doubling of the current rate of emissions cuts.China, which is the world's largest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases, agreed for the first time to peak its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and to dramatically scale up the use of renewable energy in its economy, to about 20% by 2020.Then on Friday, in a speech at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Obama announced that the U.S. would contribute $3 billion into the Green Climate Fund, which aims to help developing countries improve their climate resilience, and transition away from fossil fuels like coal.These countries are expected to be hit hardest by global warming impacts, such as rising sea levels.Big applause line in Australia when Obama talks climate deal w/China.\"If China and the US can agree on this, the world can agree on this.\"— David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 15, 2014Australia is one of several industrialized countries not to have made a pledge yet, and Abbott indicated that his government probably would not be doing so, although news reports suggest a final decision has not been made.Australia has reportedly been blocking the G20 from including language in the summit communique encouraging nations to contribute to the Green Climate Fund.The communique is a consensus-driven document that describes the views of the nations attending the summit.In his Friday speech, Obama referenced Australia's waffling on global warming policies, earning laughter and applause from the crowd of students, professors and Australian dignitaries.Meanwhile, in his opening address at the start of the G20, Abbott did not mention climate change at all.\"As we develop, as we focus on our economies, we cannot forget the need to lead on the global fight against climate change,\" Obama said of the G20 nations, according to a White House transcript of the speech.\"Now, I know that’s -- I know there’s been a healthy debate in this country about it.Here in the Asia Pacific, nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change.\"He then described the impact of climate change on Australia:Here, a climate that increases in temperature will mean more extreme and frequent storms, more flooding, rising seas that submerge Pacific islands.Here in Australia, it means longer droughts, more wildfires.The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened.Worldwide, this past summer was the hottest on record.No nation is immune, and every nation has a responsibility to do its part.Obama also called on the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions:And you’ll recall at the beginning, I said the United States and Australia has a lot in common.Well, one of the things we have in common is we produce a lot of carbon.Part of it’s this legacy of wide-open spaces and the frontier mentality, and this incredible abundance of resources.And so, historically, we have not been the most energy-efficient of nations, which means we’ve got to step up.In contrast, Abbott told reporters that the U.S. and China have a far greater responsibility to address climate change than Australia does.“China emits some 24% of global carbon dioxide,” Abbott told reporters in Canberra on Nov. 14.“The U.S. emits some 15% of global carbon dioxide.By contrast, Australia’s about 1%.So, I think it’s important that they do get cracking when it comes to this.”Obama: \"I have not had a chance to visit the Great Barrier Reef ... and I want to come back!\"In his speech, Obama made a particular appeal to the Australian audience by referencing the Great Barrier Reef, which is under threat from increasing ocean temperatures and ocean acidification, both of which are largely the result of manmade global warming.If China and the United States can agree on this, then the world can agree on this.We can get this done.And it is necessary for us to get it done.Because I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef, and I want to come back, and I want my daughters to be able to come back, and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit.And I want that there 50 years from now.Obama also joked that his staff was \"very excited for Bris Vegas,\" and referenced XXXX, a local beer.He described Brisbane as “beautiful one day, perfect the next.\"Aussie beers on tap in the press file (but not turned on).Obama gave the Four X a shoutout in his speech pic.twitter.com/nLYZ0wNele— David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 15, 2014Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Ban, who was rallying world leaders to agree to a new, effective climate agreement by the end of next year, told reporters on Friday that climate change should be at the top of the G20 agenda.“Climate change is the defining issue of our times; therefore it is only natural that the G20 leaders should focus on this,” he said.BONUS: 6 Common Myths About Climate ChangeExtreme weather and climate events are one of the most tangible impacts of global warming so far.Such extremes hit close to home, whether you live in the U.S., Europe, Africa or Asia.Scientists have been making significant advances in their understanding of how the characteristics of certain extreme weather events, such as heat waves and heavy rain or snowstorms, are or are not changing as a result of manmade climate change.What the public often hears is the message that the weather is growing more extreme, and that this trend is only going to worsen with time.However, this is an over-generalization of what's really going on.Yes, some extreme events are already becoming more common and severe.But others are not, or are undergoing changes that haven't been attributed to global warming so far.So, scientists say that some extreme weather events are become more extreme, but not all aspects of weather are.(At least not yet.)There is much research yet to be done.The fundamentalsEvery weather event that occurs today takes place in an atmosphere that has been fundamentally altered by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil for energy.As a result, there is now more carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas, in the air than there has been at any other point in human history.There is also more water vapor in the air, which provides energy for storms and can lead to more extreme precipitation events.In other words, all weather now occurs against a different backdrop, with different ingredients, than it did before.It's like cooking a dish with slightly different ingredients to start with, every time.In a sense, many climate scientists now view all extreme weather events with increasing suspicion.However, tying an extreme event to climate change is no easy task, scientifically speaking.But even in cases where plenty of scientific evidence exists that ties an extreme storm to climate change, it's best to think of the role that global warming plays as being akin to the driver of the getaway car associated with a crime.Climate change rarely, if ever, holds up the bank; instead, it plays an enabling role.That's why you won't hear climate specialists say that global warming \"caused\" a particular storm to occur.Another popular analogy is the steroids comparison.In this analogy, global warming plays a similar role that performance-enhancing drugs can play in allowing a baseball player to hit more home runs over the long-term.Just as it's difficult to prove that a specific home run was because of steroids, over time a player's inflated home run statistics will become clear, as the drugs increase the odds of home runs over time.Similarly, climate change stacks the deck in favor of certain extreme events.Global warming's role depends on the event you're talking aboutThe science is largely in when it comes to two particular extreme events: heat waves and heavy precipitation events.The science is less clear when dealing with hurricanes, and even more uncertainty exists with the relationship between tornadoes and a warming climate.(But even there, the science is getting more precise.)Researchers still have a lot to learn, and a sub-field within climate science, known as extreme event attribution, is still in its infancy.Here's a summary of what scientists know regarding how global warming is already altering, or is likely to change, the characteristics of each of these extreme events.1.Heat wavesThe bottom line: There are more of them, they're lasting longer, and they are getting more intense.According to the most recent scientific research, there is evidence showing that the number of warm days and nights has increased globally, while the number of cold days and nights has decreased.The frequency of heat waves has gone up in Europe, Asia and Australia, according to a comprehensive report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The IPCC said that it is likely that human activities more than doubled the chances for heat waves in some parts of the world, while it's less clear whether heat-related human mortality is climbing as cold-related mortality is decreasing.According to a study published in 2012, the odds of extremely hot summers (above a particular temperature threshold) have risen at a dramatic rate since the middle of the 20th century.According to the study, during the period from 1951-1980, extremely hot summers covered just 1% of Earth’s land area.This had risen to 10% of the Earth’s land area by the period from 1981-2010, and even higher during the 2006-2010 period.To put this another way, the study found that the odds of such extreme summers were about 1-in-300 during the 1951-1980 timeframe, but had increased to nearly 1-in-10 by 1981-2010.Scientists have conducted climate attribution studies of many individual heat events, sometimes with rather startling results.For example, a groundbreaking study on the 2003 European heat wave -- an event that killed at least more than 40,000 people -- found that global warming made the deadly heat wave much more likely to occur.Some of the most definitive findings linking extreme heat events to climate change were published in September of this year.They detail record-shattering heat in Australia in 2013, when the Bureau of Meteorology was famously forced to add a new color to its weather maps to show extremely hot temperatures up to 129 degrees Fahrenheit.The studies, which were published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, showed extremely low chances that the heat could have occurred without manmade global warming.One of the studies found the percent of risk of the event that could be attributable to manmade global warming to be \"essentially 100%.\"September 2013 was the hottest September on record in Australia, and one of the studies found that the risk of such heat in September has jumped fivefold due to manmade climate change.Scientists gain confidence in conclusions about extreme events when multiple studies use different methods, while arriving at similar conclusions.Five independent research teams looked at different factors related to the record heat in Australia in 2013, and each team came to the separate conclusion that human-caused climate change increased the likelihood and severity of that event.This raises scientists' confidence that global warming made the prolonged heat wave in Australia much worse.2.Extreme precipitation eventsThe bottom line: Extreme precipitation events (both rain and snow) are becoming more likely and common across broad regions of the world.With warming air and ocean temperatures, there is now more evaporation taking place on average worldwide.This is putting more water vapor in the air, thereby providing more fuel for storms and leading to more extreme precipitation events.The increase in precipitation events is not uniform worldwide, with some areas becoming drier while others are getting wetter.Global average surface temperatures have already warmed by about 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, with more warming expected during the next several decades or more.Research has shown that global average water vapor is increasing as temperatures rise.The IPCC found that there is a 90% chance or greater that with increased temperatures in coming years, extreme precipitation events will \"become more intense and frequent in many regions.\"The areas most at risk for increases in heavy rain or snow events are the mid-latitudes and the wet tropical regions of the world, including the Amazon, rainforests of Southeast Asia, and much of North America, Europe and Asia.A series of analyses published earlier this year about two different flooding events that took place in 2013, including the Boulder, Colorado, flooding and the Elbe River and Danube River flooding in Europe -- found either no influence or a decreasing risk of such events due to global warming.The findings did not rule out a role for climate change in causing these events, but rather showed that they could not be confirmed using certain existing scientific methods.The National Climate Assessment, released earlier this year, showed a sharp uptick in heavy precipitation events across the U.S. between 1958 and 2012.These precipitation events can lead to expensive and deadly floods that the country's infrastructure, such as the interstate highway system, is ill-prepared to withstand.Major floods occurred this year in Detroit, Michigan, the Washington, D.C. area, and Pensacola, Florida, for example.A study published in the journal Nature in 2011 found that global warming boosted the odds of a flood that caused extensive damage in England in 2000.Currently, it takes many months, if not longer, for scientists to conduct extreme event attribution studies.However, a group of researchers in the U.S. and U.K. is currently working on finding ways to dramatically shrink that time down, so that a storm's ties to climate change can be explored in near real-time.Climate change is a critical discussion in this day and age, and communicating its intricacies can be a challenge.At the Mashable Media Summit we've added a session on telling the stories of climate change in

about 190 countries began their latest in more than two decades of meetings to discuss how to slow and reverse long-term, manmade global warming.The discussions, technically known as the 20th conference of the parties to the 1992 U.N. Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are aimed at producing a blueprint that can be molded into a new global climate agreement by next year, and would enter into force in 2020.One can be forgiven for viewing these talks with considerable skepticism, considering that they have resulted in a world in which greenhouse gas emissions continue increasing, not decreasing, and where the chances of averting the worst consequences from global warming -- such as the virtual disappearance of the Greenland ice sheet, which would send global average sea levels soaring -- are declining.“The window of opportunity to reduce emissions will close soon,” said Peru's environment minister and president of the new climate talks, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, at the opening session of the climate talks.As Pulgar-Vidal alluded to in his remarks, the Lima climate talks are occurring at a time of unprecedented momentum in the climate arena.They are the first round of climate talks to take place post-Peoples' Climate March, post-U.S.-China emissions announcement, and post-Green Climate Fund commitments.They are also taking place during what is likely to be Earth's warmest year since at least the dawn of instrument records in 1880, and very likely much longer than that.However, the new, post-2020 agreement, even if it is politically ambitious, is unlikely to avert the stated intention of the UNFCCC itself (which even the U.S., which is often skittish about global treaties, signed onto).That agreement calls for the avoidance of \"dangerous... interference with the climate system.\"Politically, that rather vague wording has been interpreted to mean that warming would have to be limited to at or below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial average temperatures (what the global average temperature was in about 1850).World leaders agreed to this target during the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 and again in Cancun in 2010.However, growing emissions of greenhouse gases since then mean that this target is slipping further from our grasp.Speaking before delegates to the climate talks on Monday, Rajendra Pachauri, who chairs the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the definition of \"dangerous\" global warming is not one for scientists to determine, but rather belongs in the political realm.Still, he presented the task of meeting the 2-degree goal as a near Herculean one, considering the level of ambition going into the Lima meeting.“Science cannot tell us what is dangerous” interference with #climate system, @IPCC_CH chair Pachauri tells #COP20— Andrew Freedman (@afreedma) December 1, 2014Pachauri - Meeting 2 deg C emissions target requires emissions to be reduced to 0 or “negative” by 2100.#COP20— Andrew Freedman (@afreedma) December 1, 2014Pachauri told delegates that the world has used well over half (65%) its \"carbon budget\" that is compatible with the 2-degree goal, with just about 35% of the budget left.(The carbon budget is the estimated maximum amount of carbon dioxide that could be emitted over time while staying within the 2-degree Celsius limit.)In order to keep the 2-degree target viable, Pachauri said, global emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, would need to peak within a decade, and decline to zero or even negative numbers by the year 2100.The less we cut emissions now, the more expensive and steeper we'd need to cut emissions in coming decades, studies show.Nothing of that scale is currently being considered.Take the U.S.-China joint announcement about emissions cuts on Nov. 12, for example.It was appropriately hailed as a landmark development in climate policy, but didn't even commit one of the parties to cutting emissions at all.Instead, it addressed the major challenge of China's rapidly growing emissions.China, which is the world's largest absolute carbon emitter, for the first time committed to capping its emissions by 2030 or earlier, and also vowed to increase its use of renewable energy to 20% of national energy production.The U.S., for its part, committed to cutting emissions by between 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, which represents a doubling of the rate of emissions reductions that had previously been planned.All eyes in Lima are now on India, where the new government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to announce a post-2020 climate commitment.India is the third largest emitter, and as a rapidly developing country, it is also on a growing emissions trajectory.Therefore, its reaction to the U.S.-China moves will have major consequences for the future climate.Right now, in the absence of more ambitious emissions reduction targets, scientists have said we're on course to see an increase in global average temperatures of between 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit to 14 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.Studies have shown that warming on that scale would compromise the stability of the Greenland ice sheet, destabilize parts of Antarctica, cause sweeping changes in ecosystems and raise the risk of deadly heat waves and other extreme weather events, among other impacts.As scientists put it in a recent report: \"The consequences of such a temperature rise would be catastrophic.\"Even if warming were limited to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, we're still in for more severe and longer-lasting heat waves, more precipitation extremes, and dramatic changes in global ecosystems that could threaten many species' survival.There are increasing signs that the financial sector is picking up on the fact that, if we are going to have a decent shot at limiting manmade global warming to the level that world leaders have already agreed to, oil and gas companies are going to have to leave much of their proven oil and gas reserves in the ground, rather than exploiting them for profit.This, in turn, could mean that fossil fuel companies are a far riskier investment option for individuals and institutions than most people realize, effectively creating a \"carbon bubble\" that could destabilize the world economy.Once relegated to an idea expressed at environmental conferences, the concept of so-called \"stranded assets\" that could constitute a carbon bubble has never been closer to going mainstream.The biggest sign of this came on Monday, when the Bank of England revealed that it is investigating whether fossil fuel assets, such as coal and oil, pose a financial stability risk because many of these resources would need to be left untouched in order to meet internationally agreed-upon climate goals.Ever since the housing bubble helped kick start the economic crisis in 2008, the possibility of a hidden, systemic financial risk is one that financial regulators may have less tolerance for now.The letter from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank, to the chairman of Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee, dated on Oct. 30, 2014, represents the first indication that a prominent financial regulator (equivalent to the U.S. Federal Reserve) is concerned that coal, oil and gas reserves could become financially-troubled stranded assets.The inquiry represents a widening of an already-planned Bank of England study on the financial risks associated with climate change, with the full report due out in July of next year.The Carbon Tracker Initiative, which is a British environmental think tank that has produced reports on the growing risks of stranded fossil fuel assets, applauded the Bank's decision to address the issue, calling it \"momentous.\"\"The Bank of England has set a new standard for all central banks and financial regulators on climate risks by agreeing to examine, for the first time, the vulnerability that fossil fuel assets could pose to the stability of the financial system in a carbon constrained world,\" the group said in a statement.\"Carbon Tracker welcomes the Bank of England’s announcement as one vital step towards the levels of risk monitoring of fossil fuel assets required to manage the oncoming energy transition in an orderly manner.\"Separately, at U.N. climate talks in Lima, Peru, which got underway on Dec. 2, the top U.N. climate official described fossil fuels as a \"high risk\" investment that is \"getting more and more risky.\"Burning everything would bust the carbon budgetIn 2009 and 2010, world leaders agreed to the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.This is regarded as an increasingly ambitious target, in light of recent increases in emissions, but in order to have a decent shot at meeting this goal, countries can emit a limited amount of greenhouse gases over the coming decades.According to the U.N., the world has already used about 65% of its \"carbon budget\" that is compatible with the 2-degree goal, with just about 35% left.In order to keep the 2-degree target viable, global emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, would need to peak within a decade, and decline to zero or even negative numbers by the year 2100.The less we cut emissions now, the more expensive it would be and the steeper we'd need to cut emissions in coming decades, studies show.Burning all oil and gas reserves, which many energy companies would hope to be able to do (and in at least one prominent case, plan to do), would completely break the carbon bank.As the Carbon Tracker Initiative has shown, there are more fossil fuels listed on the world’s capital markets than can be burned without blowing the target.A 2013 report from the initiative said that only about 20% of currently listed fossil fuel reserves can be burned before 2050, otherwise the 2 degree Celsius target will not be met.\"As a result the global economy already faces the prospect of assets becoming stranded, with the problem only likely to get worse if current investment trends continue -- in effect, a carbon bubble,\" the report says.The report warned energy company investors that between 60 to 80% of coal, oil and gas reserves of listed energy firms \"are unburnable\" in a carbon-constrained world.This view was publicly endorsed by Todd Stern, the chief U.S. climate negotiator, in a speech at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 24.Regarding a new U.N. climate agreement, Stern said: “It is going to have to be a solution that leaves a lot of fossil fuel assets in the ground,” according to The Guardian newspaper.“We are not going to get rid of fossil fuel overnight but we are not going to solve climate change on the basis of all the fossil fuels that are in the ground are going to have to come out.That’s pretty obvious.”Yet the question of whether fossil fuel companies are getting the message is another matter.According to the Carbon Tracker Initiative, instead of beginning to shift their investments away from fossil fuels, energy companies have been doubling down on them, spending nearly $700 billion in the 2012-13 period for finding new energy reserves.The poster child for the head-in-the-sand approach to climate change is Exxon Mobil Corp.In April, the world's largest publicly-traded oil company released documents showing that it does not see the need to consider limiting the exploitation of its oil and gas reserves through the year 2040.The company told its shareholders that it does not need to plan for aggressive carbon emissions cuts before 2040, because governments are unlikely to impose such expensive regulations.Exxon said its plans call for all of its oil and gas reserves to be exploited for generating electricity and powering transportation, among other uses, through 2040.Therefore, the company said, none of its oil and gas reserves are at risk of becoming “stranded assets.”“... We are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become ‘stranded,’ the company’s report said.“We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide, and in preventing consumers -- especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable economies -- from themselves becoming stranded in the global pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic opportunity.”If all of Exxon’s oil and gas reserves were to be exploited, that would release at least 7.01 gigatons of carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas, based on 2013 data the group Fossil Free Indexes provided to Mashable.This is likely to be an underestimate, however, as other figures floating around have pegged Exxon Mobil's reserves as containing closer to 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide.Still, the 7 gigaton figure amounts to higher potential emissions than what was actually put into the air in 2013 from burning coal, oil and natural gas for energy generation in the U.S.Nestled in the heart of the Chesapeake Bay is a tiny island community that is the last of its kind.On Smith Island, there is no hospital or police station.There are few cars and just one school.The doors stay unlocked at night.This small utopia is the only remaining inhabited island in Maryland, where the 267 residents make their living catching oysters and blue crabs.Many islanders can trace their ancestry back to the English colonists who settled the island in the 17th century.Today, they still speak in the Cornish dialect of these ancestors.But these residents may be Smith Island’s last.Similar to the surrounding islands who have all lost their communities, Smith Island is falling victim to erosion and rising waters.In the Chesapeake Bay, the water is rising at twice the world average, and the land around the Bay is sinking.Scientists estimate that this island town will be underwater sometime in the next 30 to 100 years.Despite this despairing future, the residents remain optimistic, going about their days catching crabs, going to church, and sustaining the community that has defined Smith Island for centuries.Shortly after Super Typhoon Haiyan ravaged his home country in November of last year, a slim, soft-spoken and totally unknown climate negotiator from the Philippines found himself overcome by emotion when addressing a U.N. climate summit in Warsaw, Poland.Yeb Saño, one of three climate commissioners from the Philippines, broke down in tears as he pleaded with representatives from other nations to commit to reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent future superstorms like Haiyan.He spoke of family members still unaccounted for, combing through rubble to search for survivors.Saño started a hunger strike during the climate talks that gained participants around the world, effectively establishing himself as the emotional core of the otherwise staid negotiations, which often get lost in a blizzard of acronyms and minutiae.Now, however, as the U.N. climate talks enter a critical phase in Lima, Peru through Dec. 12, that voice of conscience is missing in action.Instead of navigating the conference center in Lima, Saño finds himself at home in Manila, with no explanation as to why he was left off the Philippines' official delegation at the last minute.In an eerie and frightening coincidence, another super typhoon is bearing down on his country, and may hit the same region devastated by Haiyan last year.His absence has not gone unnoticed, though, as many climate activists held a hunger strike at the start of the climate talks to mark his absence.Reached by Skype in Manila, Saño says he is at a loss for why he is there, and not in Lima, but that he supports his government's negotiating position, which is to secure an agreement that would limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, as world leaders have previously agreed to.So far, international emissions reduction commitments are woefully insufficient to meeting that goal.They can silence my mouth.But they cannot silence my soul.— Yeb Saño (@YebSano) December 4, 2014“I am also wondering why I am not in Lima right now,\" he said.He remains a commissioner for climate change, one of three that his country has.The other two are in Lima.Typically, he said, all three go to the annual talks.“I can only speculate because I don’t know what goes on in the minds of some people who have made this decision.I am reluctant to comment on this right now because things are not yet settled down right now, I am still at a loss as to why I am not on the delegation right now,” he said.“I stand supportive of what needs to be fought for in Lima and now I want to focus on the incoming storm and in fact it’s probably a blessing in disguise that I am in the Philippines because there is a lot of work that needs to be done.”“We of course face another monster storm and I will be spending the next couple of days in helping communities insure that they are prepared.”If Saño is being reprimanded for his use of emotion in the diplomatic process, it makes little sense in the context of the climate talks, which have stretched back more than two decades.His may have been the most sympathetic outpouring in the history of the negotiations, however.In a speech at the start of the meeting in Warsaw, Saño told delegates from more than 190 countries:To anyone who continues to deny the reality that is climate change, I dare you to get off your ivory tower and away from the comfort of you armchair.I dare you to go to the islands of the Pacific, the islands of the Caribbean and the islands of the Indian ocean and see the impacts of rising sea levels; to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas and the Andes to see communities confronting glacial floods, to the Arctic where communities grapple with the fast dwindling polar ice caps, to the large deltas of the Mekong, the Ganges, the Amazon, and the Nile where lives and livelihoods are drowned, to the hills of Central America that confronts similar monstrous hurricanes, to the vast savannas of Africa where climate change has likewise become a matter of life and death as food and water becomes scarce.Not to forget the massive hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern seaboard of North America.And if that is not enough, you may want to pay a visit to the Philippines right now.\"We cannot sit and stay helpless staring at this international climate stalemate.It is now time to take action.We need an emergency climate pathway,\" Saño said.\"I speak for my delegation.But more than that, I speak for the countless people who will no longer be able to speak for themselves after perishing from the storm.\"By the end of the speech, Saño was in tears.He was not the first, nor is he the last, climate negotiator to gain fame for an emotional speech.Another was Kevin Conrad, who, while serving as the climate negotiator for Papua New Guinea, castigated the U.S. for blocking an agreement in Bali, Indonesia, in 2007.The U.S. backed down shortly after the speech.Where am I?I am in my motherland, The Philippines.I stand with my people as we face another super typhoon.#YebNotInLima— Yeb Saño (@YebSano) December 4, 2014However, he is among the only ones with crossover appeal from the hallowed halls of diplomacy to the anything goes world of advocacy, with people around the world inspired by his actions citing him in their hunger strikes and other campaigns.As Super Typhoon Hagupit moves toward the Philippines, potentially striking the city of Manila or the city of Tacloban, which is still struggling to get back on its feet after last year's storm, Saño says his government does not see such storms as separate from climate change.“We don’t look at these extreme events in isolation from the overall patterns,\" he said.\"The Philippines has been visited by extreme storms even outside of typhoon season, and outside the traditional typhoon belt in recent years.”Saño says his country is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change, given that it is an archipelago that sits in the middle of the typhoon belt.It is prone to impacts from sea level rise as well as changes in storm intensity, frequency and tracks.“We stand from a perspective of being a very vulnerable country and for us it is merely a matter of averting this crisis, meaning being able to fulfill the temperature targets” the world has already agreed to, he said.“The 2 degree Celsius target must be met if we are to prevent more dangerous climate change.”The goal of the Lima talks is to come up with a draft climate agreement that can be agreed to at another round of negotiations in Paris, France in December of 2015.The new treaty is slated to go into force in 2020.Saño says his fellow negotiators in Lima are working to ensure there is a “definitive direction toward an agreement in Paris that will be consistent with meeting that scientific imperative of not going beyond 2 degrees Celsius.”“That is our objective… that can only be done in our view if all countries are on board.”At the opening ceremony of the Lima talks, Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), told delegates that the world has used well over half (65%) its \"carbon budget\" that is compatible with the 2-degree goal, with just about 35% of the budget left.(The carbon budget is the estimated maximum amount of carbon dioxide that could be emitted over time while staying within the 2 degree Celsius limit.)In order to keep the 2 degree target viable, Pachauri said, global emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, would need to peak within a decade, and decline to zero or even negative numbers by the year 2100.“We’ve reached a point where even the most ambitious targets by the richest nations will no longer be enough to meet the scientific target,\" Saño said, adding that this means there is a greater need for financial aid for the most vulnerable nations such as the Philippines.For Saño, Typhoon Hagupit, which is known as Ruby in the Philippines, is just the latest example of how urgent this need is.Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Lima, Peru on Thursday afternoon just as it appeared that the latest round of global climate treaty talks were on the verge of limping toward a dispiriting conclusion.Kerry has long been dedicated to moving the world toward a future with lower emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for causing global warming, and he challenged all nations, rich and poor, to overcome differences over draft negotiating text and take a crucial step closer to reaching a new global climate agreement that would apply to the post-2020 period.“This is an issue that is personal for me, just as it is personal for you,” he said in a speech to delegates and journalists.“This issue should be personal for absolutely everybody.”Leaders are facing a 2015 deadline for finalizing and passing a new climate treaty at a December summit in Paris, France.The Lima talks are aimed at coming up with the negotiating text that will be further honed in Paris and at a round of talks between now and then.However, when Kerry touched down in Peru, the draft negotiating text had swelled to an unwieldy 50 pages plus, and discussions on it have proceeded in fits and starts as negotiators try to navigate different positions, political posturing and distrust bred over the course of more than two decades of climate diplomacy.The key sticking points in the talks so far center on what will be required for countries to include as part of the nationally-determined emissions cuts they will announce early next year, as well as calls for more climate change-related adaptation and mitigation aid from industrialized countries going to developing nations.Another big question hanging over the meeting is how a new treaty will ensure that each country's emissions commitments meet the needs of ensuring that global warming stays under the globally-agreed upon target of 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial temperatures.The U.S. wants the emissions reduction commitments, technically known as “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions,” or INDCs, to focus mainly on actions to limit the severity of climate change, whereas many other countries want commitments for climate adaptation measures to be included as well.All INDCs are supposed to be finalized by the end of March 2015.The text amounts to a wish list from nearly every party to the negotiations, and includes language that may not survive closer scrutiny but is consistent with recent climate science findings, such as a provision calling for zero greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2050.Kerry’s speech was clearly aimed at trying to reach negotiators who are frustrated about the impasses between rich and poor nations that have tended to dominate every negotiating session since climate diplomacy began more than two decades ago.Kerry repeatedly emphasized that “every nation has an obligation to do its part,” including developing countries, where emissions are rising rapidly.“If you are a big developed nation and you are not helping to lead, then you are part of the problem,” Kerry said, in a subtle reference to countries such as Canada and Australia, whose governments have been openly skeptical of mainstream climate science, and are missing their previously agreed-to emissions reduction targets.“There is nothing preordained about the course we’re on, except habits, bad habits,” Kerry said.The U.S. has come into the Lima Climate Summit with considerably more clout than it has had in previous meetings, after striking a joint agreement with China to commit to further emissions reductions.The U.S.-China agreement, announced Nov. 12, marked the first time that China had agreed to halt the growth of its greenhouse gas emissions, promising to reach peak emissions on or before 2030.China also committed to dramatically expand its use of renewable energy sources for generating electricity.Kerry: Countries have to set political posturing asideKerry cited the U.S.-China deal as inspiration for what is possible in Lima.“We have to approach this problem with the urgency that it deserves,” Kerry said, while acknowledging that the divisions between countries are still significant.“I know the discussions can be tense.\"“The fact is that we simply don’t have time going back and forth about whose responsibility it is to act,” Kerry said, in reference to developing countries’ demands that industrialized countries shoulder most of the burden for emissions reductions.Kerry said he and President Barack Obama understand that America’s history as a major emitter since the start of the industrial revolution means that the U.S. must take the lead on this issue, but that doesn’t mean that developing countries can keep building coal-fired power plants and increasing their emissions, since that would overwhelm the influence of the emissions cuts at home.“No single country, not even the U.S., can solve this problem or foot this bill alone.That’s not rhetoric, it is literally impossible,” he said.“It’s the net amount of carbon that matters, not each country’s share.”Environmental groups applauded Kerry for coming to Lima, becoming the first Secretary of State to attend the annual climate talks since Hillary Clinton did in 2009 at the Copenhagen Climate Summit.“Kerry injected much-needed political energy into the sluggish negotiations here in Lima,” said Lou Leonard of the World Wildlife Fund, in a statement.“Kerry’s presence here should help to prop up the talks just as they are starting to falter and fall victim to political tunnel vision.”Other groups, such as Friends of the Earth, criticized the U.S. negotiating team in Lima for pushing for a non-legally binding global agreement in Paris, because of staunch opposition to a climate agreement in the upcoming Republican-controlled Senate.Michael Jacobs, senior adviser to New Climate Economy and a former climate adviser to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said that despite the negotiating difficulties so far, Lima’s goal of coming up with a workable negotiating text that will lead to the Paris talks in 2015 is likely to be accomplished in the end, even if it takes negotiators into the first part of the weekend.“We need a text to take into negotiations next year,” Jacobs said in an interview on Wednesday.“That is the outcome we wanted and we’re going to get that.”“I don’t see these positions so far apart that they can’t be resolved.\"Diplomats at the United Nations Climate Summit in Lima, Peru, have had a deceptively difficult task during the past two weeks: come up with a draft agreement that can be further honed over the course of the next year, and agreed to at a summit in Paris in December 2015.However, they do not need to finalize all the language, dotting all the i's and crossing the t's.All parties agree that there needs to be a strong, workable framework for an agreement -- like a well-constructed foundation of a home -- that puts the world on course to cut manmade emissions of greenhouse gases after the year 2020.There's just one problem with that: Through Friday afternoon, on the last scheduled day of the summit, negotiators remained stuck on a host of issues that have bogged down the climate talks for years.That no major events from the past year -- from the largest climate rally in history to a landmark U.S.-China emissions agreement -- have broken through the typical logjam between developing countries and industrialized nations is a pessimistic sign for the enactment of a new treaty by the end of next year.So, yet again, a climate summit will likely continue well past its deadline, possibly through the day on Saturday and into the evening, according to experts in Lima.Right now, groups participating in the negotiations are warning that the text is watered down, and would likely fail to meet the stated objective that world leaders already agreed to at previous summits: preventing the world's climate from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.Meeting this goal requires that emissions of global-warming pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, peak in just the next few years, before declining to zero or negative emissions by the end of this century.(This would mean the world's trees and oceans would be absorbing more carbon than humans would be emitting.)At our current rate of emissions, the world will burn enough greenhouse gases to surpass the 2-degree target in just the next 30 years or less, climate scientists say.When are @UN_ClimateTalks going to broadcast the actual talks to the world?In the meantime follow LIVE BLOG https://t.co/le3b5x4BK5 #COP20— Petter Bjersér (@PetterBjerser) December 12, 2014What's remarkable about this summit is the shifting politics around climate worldwide, with the emergence of a robust social movement backing climate action in the U.S. and Latin America, for example.In addition, the joint U.S.-China climate agreement prior to the talks was thought to provide an opening for an ambitious draft agreement in Lima, but so far, that has not been the case.Instead, countries have at times returned to stating positions they took at past climate negotiations.\"These aren't earth-shattering decisions ... they are kind of proxy fights,\" said Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\"There hasn't been that small room yet, where all the ministers are sitting down and coming up with an agreement they can live with.\"Key sticking points as of Friday afternoon:What will countries have to disclose when they communicate their emissions-reduction commitments?A key point of contention concerns the emissions-reduction commitments that countries have to communicate to the U.N. by the end of March 2015.In U.N. climate jargon, these are known as \"intended nationally determined contributions,\" or INDCs.Countries are disagreeing over whether they will also need to commit additional financing to help developing nations adapt to climate change impacts and transition to a lower-carbon economy as part of these communications, as well as how they will be reviewed to ensure they are adequate and fair.“This is a sticking point,\" Kelly Dent, economic justice coordinator for Oxfam, told Mashable in an interview from Lima.\"Until that’s agreed, I think we’re going to be in for a very long night tonight, and maybe even tomorrow night.”For example, Brazil, the European Union, African countries are among those that want to have a very robust set of information when nations propose their targets.Others, however, are advocating that it should be up to each country individually to decide what information to include.“There needs to be some way of assessing each country’s contribution against the temperature target of 2 degrees Celsius,\" Dent said.What are countries going to do to reduce their emissions before 2020, when the next treaty is slated to go into effect?Some countries, particularly developing nations, are seeking language in a Lima agreement that would encourage or mandate additional emissions cuts from industrialized nations before 2020.Scientific reports published in the past year have shown that the earlier emissions start decreasing, the lower the ultimate costs and global warming-related damage will be.“We are really concerned that the current draft lacks specific actions to address pre-2020 emissions necessary to limit warming to 1.5-2 degrees [Celsius].It seems that governments in Lima are happy to leave hard decisions on climate change to the governments of tomorrow.This is a recipe for a climate nightmare,\" Tasneem Essop, head of the climate-summit delegation for the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement to reporters.What about \"long-term finance?\"Also at play is what additional funds industrialized countries will commit to helping developing countries adapt to climate impacts before the year 2020.So far, countries including the U.S. have pledged a total of a little more than $10 billion to this effort, but they had promised $100 billion annually by the year 2020.How this additional money will be raised, and what strings it might come with, has been a tension running throughout the two weeks of talks in Lima.Trinidad and Tobago - we cannot live with a preamble that does not include a goal to limit temp increase to 2 or 1.5 degs #adp— Sophie Whitehead (@SophieW_1992) December 12, 2014At the end of the day, it's likely that a Lima agreement governing the INDCs will be reached before the end of the weekend, and that a separate, lengthy draft text of a potential Paris agreement will also emerge.The latter document will mainly be a compilation of country views on what should be in a longer-term global-warming agreement, potentially including a provision to radically cut global greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by the year 2050 (which was present in earlier drafts).But the stumbling blocks encountered at this summit in Lima raise legitimate questions about whether a new treaty can really be enacted next year -- when the stakes are going to be much higher.LIMA, Peru — Already well into overtime, U.N. climate talks reached a standstill Saturday, as developing countries rejected a draft deal they said would allow rich countries to shirk their responsibilities to fight global warming and pay for its impacts.The main goal for the two-week session in Lima was relatively modest: reach agreement on what information should go into the pledges that countries submit for a global climate pact expected to be adopted next year in Paris.But even that became complicated, as several developing nations rejected a draft decision they said blurred the distinction between what rich and poor countries can be expected to do.\"We have deadlock,\" Chinese negotiator Liu Zhenmin told the conference, siding with Malaysia and other developing countries that rejected the draft.U.S. representative Todd Stern said he was open to tweaking the language, but warned against lengthy negotiations, noting that the conference had already passed its scheduled Friday close.\"Failing to produce the decision before us will be seen as a serious breakdown,\" which could put the Paris agreement and the entire U.N. process at risk, Stern said.Groups participating in the negotiations are warning that the text is watered down, and would likely fail to meet the stated objective that world leaders already agreed to at previous summits: preventing the world's climate from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.#ADP Co-Chairs will submit text to #COP20 President

quickly in Lima, as rifts reopened over who should do what to fight global warming.Developed countries want the pledges to focus on emissions cuts, while developing nations also want to see commitments of financial support.Some small island states at risk of being flooded by rising seas also complained the draft made no mention of a \"loss and damage\" mechanism agreed upon in last year's talks in Poland.\"We need a permanent arrangement to help the poorest of the world,\" said Ian Fry, negotiator for the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu.Meanwhile, top carbon polluter China and other major developing countries opposed plans for a review process that would allow the pledges to be compared against one another before Paris.Although negotiating tactics always play a role, virtually all disputes in the U.N. talks reflect the wider issue of how to divide the burden of fixing the global warming that scientists say results from human activity, primarily the burning of oil, coal and natural gas.Historically, Western nations are the biggest emitters.Currently, most carbon emissions come from developing countries, as they grow their economies and lift millions of people

already happening, and include rising sea levels, intensifying heat waves and shifts in weather patterns causing floods in some areas and droughts in others.The U.N. weather agency said last week that 2014 could become the hottest year on record.Additional reporting by Mashable, Andrew FreedmanLIMA, Peru — Climate negotiators salvaged a compromise deal in Lima early Sunday that sets the stage for a global pact in Paris next year, but rejected a rigorous review of the greenhouse gas emissions limits they plan.More than 30 hours behind schedule, delegates from more than 190 countries agreed on what information should go into the pledges that countries submit for the expected Paris pact.They argued all day Saturday over the wording of the decision, with developing nations worried that the text blurred the distinction between what rich and poor countries can be expected to do.The final draft alleviated those concerns with language saying countries have \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" to deal with global warming.\"As a text, it's not perfect, but it includes the positions of the parties,\" said Peru's Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who was the conference chairman, and had spent most of the day meeting separately with delegations.Lima Call for Climate Action puts world on track to Paris 2015 global climate agreement http://t.co/q74pOUS28H

center on the grounds of Peru's army headquarters.It also restored language demanded by small island states at risk of being flooded by rising seas, mentioning a \"loss and damage\" mechanism agreed upon in last year's talks in Poland that recognizes that nations hardest hit by climate change will require financial and technical help.\"We need a permanent arrangement to help the poorest of the

carbon to have a likely chance of avoiding dangerous levels of warming — defined in the U.N. talks as exceeding 2 degrees centigrade (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above 19th-century averages.Meeting this goal requires that emissions of global-warming pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, peak in just the next few years, before declining to zero or negative emissions by the end of this century.However,

record.Additional reporting by Mashable, Andrew FreedmanEven as we witness rising sea levels, record high temperatures and increasingly violent storm systems, it's still easy for us to ignore the harbingers of global warming and convince ourselves that drastic climate change is either too far off in the future or only happening in distant lands.As well tell ourselves that, however, one of our national treasures, Glacier National Park in Montana, is becoming ground zero for global warming.Since 1850, Glacier has lost more than 75% of its namesake glaciers due to soaring summer temperatures, earlier snowmelt and weakened winter snowpacks.The side-by-side photos of Montana's glaciers below demonstrate just how destructive climate change has been to one of our nation's cherished destinations.1.Boulder Peak on Boulder GlacierAnnual average temperatures in the American West have risen at twice the rate of the average global temperature increase since 1970.In few places in the West is this temperature rise more evident than in Glacier National Park in Montana, where glaciers have been receding and disappearing for decades due to warmer summers and smaller winter snowpacks in western Montana.In GNP, the number of 90 degree days has tripled since the last century.Though the park once contained 150 glaciers, it is now home to only 25, according to the United States Geological Survey.In 30 years, experts warn, Glacier National Park may be glacier-less.Boulder Glacier has lost more than 76% of its area from 1966-2005, according to the USGS.It no longer exceeds 100,000 square meters in area.2.Ice Cave on Boulder Glacier\" title=\"Glacier National Park\" src=\"http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Pair_2.jpg\" alt=\"Glacier National Park\" width=\"1920\" height=\"613\" class=\"popout\" />While visitors to Glacier National Park will still see snow on the ground for years to come, it likely won’t be enough to maintain the glaciers they came to behold.Mountain snowpacks hold less water than glaciers -- which act as water banks that regulate streamflow and stream temperature in the summer and during drought periods -- and have begun to lose water two weeks earlier in the spring.This affects farmers who depend on the snowmelt to irrigate their crops.While some farmers may receive more water in the spring from the glaciers, they now struggle to find adequate water supplies in the summer months without the glaciers that previously supplied water year-round.In the American West, 80% of the water supply comes from the mountains.3.Cheney Glacier with view of Cheney NotchGlacier National Park’s entire ecosystem is endangered by water temperatures in the summer.Without consistent snowmelt, the water temperatures rise in the summer and threaten fish species -- like bull trout and some salmon -- that rely on a regulated temperature.Another byproduct of fewer glaciers is fewer avalanches.While most associate avalanches with the loss of life (not the creation of it), avalanches are a crucial catalyst for the growth of a mountain’s ecosystem.The massive snow slides naturally clear land for wildlife species to roam and push trees into streams and rivers, creating trout habitats.Cheney Glacier lost nearly 30% of its area from 1966-2005, according to the USGS.4.Shepard Glacier\" title=\"Glacier National Park\" src=\"http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Pair_4.jpg\" alt=\"Glacier National Park\" width=\"1920\" height=\"573\" class=\"popout\" />Other species besides fish are also affected by rising water temperatures and a diminished habitat.Scientists recently studied rare western glacier stoneflies, an aquatic insect, and found that the species exists in only one of its previously reported six habitats.Lynx and wolverines, which require snow cover to survive, could be threatened by earlier snowmelts.Wildflowers typically bloom from mid-May to September, but that period now starts earlier and finishes later because of early snowmelt caused by rising temperatures and increased rainfall.Scientists do not know how birds, bees and other pollinating species will be affected by longer bloom periods.Shepard Glacier was measured in 2010.It no longer qualifies as a glacier because it decreased in size to less than 25 acres.5.Iceberg Glacier\" title=\"Glacier National Park\" src=\"http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Pair_5.jpg\" alt=\"Glacier National Park\" width=\"1920\" height=\"573\" class=\"popout\" />As glaciers and animal habitats vanish, the tourism ecosystem that employs a large number of Montana residents could also disappear.According to the National Park Service, 9 out of 10 visitors to GNP list wildlife sightseeing as one of their activities at the park.Spending by visitors to GNP may reach $1 billion annually and supports 4,000 jobs, according to the National Resources Defense Council.6.Grinnell Glacier\" title=\"Glacier National Park\" src=\"http://admin.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Pair_6.jpg\" alt=\"Glacier National Park\" width=\"1920\" height=\"681\" class=\"popout\" />When the temperature rises and snow melts early, soils dry out and forests become increasingly susceptible to wildfires.The average number of wildfires from 2000-2012 was 79% higher than it was from 1980-1989, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.Wildfire season is now more than two months longer than it was in the 1970s.7.Grinnell Glacier at Elro’s RockGrinnell Glacier has experienced an especially pronounced transformation this past decade.Daniel B. Fagre, a USGS ecologist, told The New York Times that the glacier recently lost an important ice wall that fed a lake.All told, Grinnell Glacier -- named after conservationist and explorer George Bird Grinnell, who advocated for the creation of Glacier National Park -- shrunk in area by almost 40% between 1966 and 2005, according to the USGS.8.Swiftcurrent GlacierThough Swiftcurrent Glacier is melting at a slower rate than some of GNP’s aforementioned icecaps, it’s still disintegrating.Between 1966 and 2005, according to the USGS, it lost nearly 15% of its area.9.Boulder Glacier taken near Boulder PassIt's been a rough year, meteorologically speaking, on the Blue Marble.We've seen record heat, record snow, record flooding, record drought, rising sea levels and super typhoons -- and extreme climate events are expected to continue to worsen unless humans take action to reduce emissions and slow the rise in the planet's average temperature.Take a look at the photos below to see the extreme weather and climate events that plagued 2014.Record warm yearIt is virtually certain that 2014 will go down in history as the globe's warmest year on record since instrumental records began in 1880.In a telling sign of global warming, 14 out of the 15 warmest years have all occurred since the year 2000.The warmth in 2014 has largely been driven by the oceans, which again were record-breakingly warm for November, continuing a streak of records that have been toppled during the past several months.The January-to-November period surpassed the previous record warm years of 1998 and 2010 in NOAA's database, the agency said.This is unique because both of those previous years featured El Niño events, which raise global ocean temperatures and give the planet's overall temperature a boost.So far this year, an El Niño event has failed to materialize in the Pacific Ocean, despite being forecast to do so, yet records have been set for the highest global ocean temperatures on record during several months this year.While instrument data only goes back as far as 1880, other climate records, from tree rings to coral reef samples, have shown that it is likely that the Earth has not been this warm in at least 4,000 years, with global levels of greenhouse gases at the highest level in human history.Not every climate data center is guaranteed to rank 2014 as the warmest year, due to the different data analysis method each group uses.Satellite-derived temperature data for the lower atmosphere does not show as sharp a spike in 2014 temperatures for example.Buffalo snowfallThe Buffalo, New York area was subjected to a virtual firehose of heavy snow in November when an extremely active lake effect snow pattern developed and stalled out over the same area for days at a time.Snowfall amounts reached 88 inches in Cowlesville, New York, which is a new record for the Buffalo area.Twin tornadoesTwo EF-4 tornadoes, spaced about a mile apart, tore through the small town of Pilger,, Nebraska on June 16, killing 2, while damaging the vast majority of structures in the town.As strong and photogenic as they were, however, the tornadoes were not anywhere close to unprecedented, based on an examination of tornado research and interviews with severe weather experts.However, the intensity and longevity of both funnels did strike some experts as unique.Overall, the 2014 tornado season was one of the least active in U.S. history, with less than 1,000 tornadoes touching down.This is below the average of 1,260 tornadoes that have occurred each year since the early 1950s.Interestingly, 2012 and 2013 were also unusually quiet tornado years, following deadly tornado outbreaks in 2011 that killed more than 500.Emerging scientific research shows that the frequency of tornadoes may be decreasing as the climate warms, while the timing of tornado season shifts, and big tornado outbreaks become more common.This is due to the overall increase in water vapor -- a key fuel for severe thunderstorms -- as a result of global warming, while another prime ingredient known as wind shear becomes a more limited resource.New video offers a close look at the tornadoes that ravaged through Pilger, Nebraska -- http://t.co/w61ZP7vMpT pic.twitter.com/pukc1FdLD1— Mashable (@mashable) June 17, 2014This transition to a “boom or bust” tornado regime is consistent with some climate studies showing that even if wind shear declines, it will still be present on some days, leading to potentially larger, but less frequent, outbreaks.Polar vortexRepeated bouts of extremely cold air affected the lower 48 states last winter, particularly during the month of January.Some of the cold waves were related to a weakening of the polar vortex, which is circulation that typically rings the poles during the winter.When the polar vortex winds weaken and the shape of the vortex becomes elongated, the odds of Arctic outbreaks in the U.S. and Europe increase.This NOAA graphic illustrates the temperature departures from average during early January 2014.The polar vortex is a meteorological term that has been in use since the middle of the 20th century, but it wasn't until the winter of 2013-2014 that it seeped into pop culture and took on multiple new meanings, much to the chagrin of many meteorologists.Super TyphoonsThe tropical Pacific Ocean gave rise to some incredibly intense typhoons this year, including Super Typhoon Hagupit and Super Typhoon Neoguri.Both of these storms were strong category 5 storms at one point, but fortunately they each struck land in a weakened state.Brazil droughtAn intense drought has been affecting southeastern Brazil during the past year or more, leading to water shortages in the country's capital of Sao Paulo.Water services to homes and businesses has been sporadic at times, as officials grapple with what to do if rain does not arrive soon to refill rapidly depleting reservoirs.At times, Sao Paolo has been just weeks away from completely running out of water.California droughtThe California drought is one of the state's worst short-term drought events on record.It is an example of what climate scientists project will occur more often -- while conditions dried out, California set high temperature records and is likely going to set a record for the state's warmest year.Because of the lack of surface water, farmers and other water users have drawn from aquifers deep underneath the soil to access groundwater.So much groundwater has been depleted that it would take 11 trillion gallons of water to replenish this crucial resource again, NASA scientists announced last week.Surface water is easier to replenish via precipitation compared to groundwater, which can take years to decades to recover.Deadly blizzard in the HimalayasIn mid-October, Tropical Cyclone Hudhud came ashore in east-central India.The storm funneled moisture northwestward, toward the Himalayas.There, hundreds of climbers were tackling some of the world's highest peaks in what is typically the least snowy month of the year.The blizzard and series of avalanches that resulted killed at least 40 people and injured dozens more, as the Nepalese Army had to mobilize a helicopter airlift to rescue those stranded by the severe weather.Coral bleachingWith the highest ocean temperatures on record this year, coral reefs have been suffering a greater toll than they have in many other years.In fact, some scientists think we are beginning to see what will eventually become a global coral bleaching and die-off event, the likes of which has not been observed since 1998.Corals are invertebrates that often grow in colonies in symbiosis with algae, known as zooxanthellae, which live in their tissues.It is these algae that give the corals their vibrant colors, and healthy coral reef ecosystems in turn provide food and shelter for a plethora of marine species.When ocean temperatures get too warm for too long a period of time, corals will expel the algae — giving them a sudden eviction notice.Once they do this, the corals turn a ghostly white color, which is where the term “bleaching” comes from.Corals are the tropical rain forests of the ocean -- they house an incredibly diverse array of species, and when the corals suffer from severe stress, these delicate ecosystems can be permanently damaged.Carbon dioxide seen from spaceNASA launched a new satellite in 2014 that is known as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2.This spacecraft is aimed at obtaining close-up views of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide throughout the world.Kashmir floodsExtreme rainfall associated with the seasonal South Asian Monsoon caused rivers to overflow their banks in mid-October in northwest India and parts of Pakistan, killing more than 320 people and displacing tens of thousands from the Himalayan region of Kashmir and eastern Pakistan.The floods were not as deadly as 2010 floods in a similar area, but the rainfall amounts were comparable, according to scientists.The 2010 floods, which killed about 2,000 and displaced nearly 20 million, were focused on the Indus River.The flooding this year was is in that river's tributaries, including the Chenab and Jhelum Rivers.They became so swollen that their expansion was visible from satellites orbiting the Earth.The flooding in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir was said to be the worst in at least 60 years, with communication lines cut along with electricity and strategic bridge crossings.\n"
