# NLP
Natural Language Processing and Web Scraping
# 
# The ProjectCourseURExample notebook, receives a list of URLs downloaded from the internet archives https://archive.org from within a certain time period, on any URLs related to Climate
# These URLs are scraped, and the words are tokenized, and stripped of stop words like and, or, for etc
# The remaining words are analyzed for impact and frequency. A wodcloud is created as well as other visual charts

#
# The ProjectCoursePDFExample combines given set of pdfs based on filenames indicated in the input array.
The combined pdf is then scraped of all words, which then get tokenized and eliminated of all stop words
# The resultant set of words is then organized into a wordcloud, and analyzed for frequency and relevance on given topic
